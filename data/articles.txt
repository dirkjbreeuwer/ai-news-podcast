Google has released the Pixel 7a in four gorgeous colors, and beside the regular Snow and Charcoal finishes, you get two new colors this year.

Google released the Pixel 7a at I/O 2023, unveiling the phone in four beautiful finishes. Every year, Google comes up with some really cool colors for its Pixel phones. For instance, the 2018 Pixel 3 came out in the Not Pink finish, and Pixel 4 hit the market in the Oh So Orange trim the following year. Even with the latest Pixel 7 series, the company offers a unique Lemongrass shade beside the regular white and black models.

Pixel 7a is available in four colors: Snow, Charcoal, Sea, and the online-only Coral. In each style, the aluminum camera visor is tinted to fit in with the color scheme. The Snow finish has a white rear panel with a polished aluminum frame and camera visor. However, the bezels on the front are black. For reference, it is the same color that Google offers with the flagship Pixel 7 and the Pixel 7 Pro.

Next, buyers can get the Pixel 7a in the Charcoal finish, which comes with a dark-gray rear panel/frame, similar to the Pixel 7's Obsidian variant. The black bezels are more suited to this color than to Snow. Among these, the Snow finish would suit buyers who like to use their phone with a bright theme, whereas the Charcoal finish complements the in-built dark mode on Pixel 7a. It is important to mention that these finishes differ from what users got with the Pixel 6a's Chalk and Charcoal trims.

Now, let's talk about the new colors Google hasn't used for any other smartphone: Sea and Coral. The Sea variant of the Pixel 7a has a light blue rear panel that is soothing to the eyes. The metallic frame on the sides is covered in a shiny version of the hue, giving it a pleasing look. In the promo pictures, Google flaunts this color with a similar Material You theme on the screen, which looks quite attractive. However, like the Snow trim, Sea also has black bezels on the front.

Enthusiasts who love bright phone colors should consider the Pixel 7a in Coral finish, with a pinkish-orange rear panel and a similar shiny frame. However, just like Samsung saves some colors for its online store, Google has decided to sell the Coral Pixel 7a exclusively through its online store, which means that the variant won't be available offline. No matter what color buyers end up with, the Pixel 7a is a significant upgrade over its predecessor.

HTC has surprised us with the launch of the HTC U23 Pro, a well-equipped mid-ranger, but how does it compare to the recently announced Google Pixel 7a?

While HTC’s new mid-ranger looks to be capable with a large 120Hz OLED display, a quad-camera setup and Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 power, Google’s Pixel 7a is a tough option to beat. It currently sits pretty at the top of our selection of the best mid-range phones, offering a solid all-round experience with flagship processing power and capable cameras.

Which is best for your needs? While we’re yet to go hands-on with the HTC U23 Pro, here are a few key differences between the HTC U23 Pro and Google Pixel 7a.

The Google Pixel 7a fixes one of the long-time complaints with Google’s ‘a’ series smartphones – the 60Hz refresh rate – upping the speed to a snappy 90Hz. That may still be shy of the 120Hz used by key rivals like the Poco F5 Pro, but it’s a welcome addition that helps the phone feel more responsive in everyday use.

The OLED panel is also one of the smaller displays around at 6.1 inches, though it’s not quite in true small-screen territory.

The HTC U23 Pro, on the other hand, offers a larger 6.7-inch OLED display that’s not only larger than that of the Pixel 7a, but faster too, clocking in at a smooth 120Hz. However, the difference between 90-120Hz is negligible compared to the jump from 60-90Hz, so it’s only mobile gamers that want to hit a super-smooth 120fps that it’ll notice a real difference.

Elsewhere, the larger panel should translate to a better viewing experience when watching movies on Netflix and random videos on YouTube than Google’s mid-ranger.

The HTC U23 Pro sports Qualcomm’s mid-range Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 chipset first revealed back in 2022, and combined with a healthy 12GB of RAM, should deliver decent performance – though we’ll verify that with benchmarks in the coming days. For context, we found the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1-equipped Xiaomi 13 Lite performed well in day-to-day use with no real lag or stutter.

What it can’t do, however, is compete with the flagship-tier chipset found within Google’s affordable Pixel 7a. More specifically, the Pixel 7a sports Google’s in-house-developed Tensor G2 chipset, the same chipset you’ll find within the Pixel 7, Pixel 7 Pro and recently announced Pixel Fold.

While benchmarks from our Pixel 7a review show that it’s not quite as powerful as flagship Qualcomm alternatives, day-to-day performance was smooth as could be, even when gaming.

Besides, it’s a chipset more focused on AI and machine learning, allowing the phone to do some cool stuff with camera performance and dictation – but more on that in a second.

The HTC U23 Pro looks to have a capable camera looking at its rear quad setup, but delving into the specs paints a slightly different picture. While the 108MP main and 8MP ultrawide are of note, the accompanying 5MP macro and 2MP depth sensors are less helpful on a day-to-day basis, so it’s more of a dual camera setup in reality.

That 108MP main sensor boasts decent specs too, including OIS and a wide f/1.7 aperture.

The Pixel 7a, on the other hand, sports a new OIS-enabled 64MP main sensor coupled with a 13MP ultrawide lens. While it may not win on sheer camera count, the two lenses are incredibly capable. Our reviewer noted that “it’s hard not to be impressed with the images” taken on the Pixel 7a, retaining impressive detail and natural colours.

That’s just specs, however. Where the Pixel 7a really pulls away from the U23 Pro (and most other mid-range options) is its Tensor G2-powered AI prowess. This allows for tech like Real Tone for accurate skin reproduction and 20x Super-Res Zoom, as well as powerful editing capabilities like Magic Eraser and Face Unblur.

It also boosts great AI-powered low-light performance, with our reviewer noting that the Pixel 7a delivered better low-light results than the iPhone 14 Pro Max, and often at a much quicker pace too.

While once upon a time practically every smartphone around featured a 3.5mm headphone port, that couldn’t be further from the truth in 2023.

With the cheap Bluetooth headphone revolution, many manufacturers have ditched the port in a bid to make phones slimmer and lighter – but what about those of us with high-end wired headphones?

The HTC U23 Pro has you covered in that respect, with a 3.5mm headphone jack nestled on the top edge of the smartphone. It’s sadly nowhere to be seen on the Pixel 7a, however, with its last appearance being on 2020’s Pixel 4a.

The HTC U23 Pro is slightly more expensive

While both are fairly evenly matched mid-range options, the HTC U23 Pro comes in at slightly more than Google’s budget-friendly Pixel 7a, even with a slight bump in price compared to last year’s Pixel 6a.

The HTC U23 Pro is currently available to pre-order starting at £499 (around $600), while the Google Pixel 7a will set prospective buyers back £449/$499. The Pixel 7a is available to buy now, while the HTC U23 Pro is available for pre-order now ahead of release in early June.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7: Which is the better budget buy?

Text: The Google Pixel 7a is the latest entry in Google’s smartphone portfolio, providing an even more budget-friendly alternative to 2022’s Pixel 7 and 7 Pro. In years gone by, Google has previously cut a number of features to hit the A series’ lower price point. The Pixel 7a is different, blurring the lines with the already affordable flagship. When it comes to the Google Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7, which should you buy? That’s what we’re going to decide.

If you're looking for a quick summary of the differences, here's the TDLR of the Google Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7:

Both phones offer the same powerful Google Tensor G2 processing and Titan M2 security co-processor.

The phones offer similar camera specifications, but the Pixel 7 has more features. For instance, the Pixel 7a misses out on cinematic blur and is limited to 4K30 video on its ultrawide and selfie cameras.

The Pixel 7 has a marginally larger display, but the 7a has the same resolution and refresh rate.

The Google Pixel 7 supports faster wired and wireless charging than the 7a.

Google has vastly improved the build quality of the Pixel 7a, but the Pixel 7 retains a slight edge regarding glass drop protection and water resistance.

Google's Pixel 7a is $100 cheaper than the Pixel 7 was at launch. However, Google's regular discounts on the Pixel 7 mean it's often a close all between the two.

Keep reading to learn more about the Google Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7 and how they differ.

The improved display is one of the more significant updates we noted in our Google Pixel 7a review. It boasts a smooth 90Hz maximum refresh rate, a notable upgrade over the old 60Hz panel that now matches the capabilities of the silky smooth Pixel 7. The display is a little smaller than the regular 7, but you’ll see the same FHD+ resolution at a 20:9 aspect ratio, and a snappy display-embedded fingerprint scanner too. Other noteworthy improvements include wireless charging support for the first time and improved build materials in the form of an anodized metal frame, which bring the phone even further in line with the Pixel 7.

The Pixel 7a benefits from other line-up familiarities too. Google’s Tensor G2 processor reappears, packed with flagship-level performance, reasonable gaming chops (if you don’t plan to play for too long), and an upgraded Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) that powers the phones’ best-in-class machine learning capabilities, such as Assistant voice typing and photo processing features like Night Sight. In fact, it’s the same processor as you’ll find in the more expensive Pixel 7 Pro; the entire series benefits from Google’s semi-custom processor to enable a very similar feature set across all three. It’s paired with the same 8GB RAM and 128GB base storage configuration, though the Pixel 7’s 256GB option will appeal to the more insatiable media consumer.

However, there are some subtle but key differences between the Pixel 7a and Pixel 7. The regular model has a slightly better IP68 rating than the 7a’s IP67. However, the Pixel 7a comes with Bluetooth 5.3, up from 5.2. The Pixel 7a is also slower to charge and the camera setup is slightly different as well. We’ll take a closer look at both in more detail in a moment, though. Finally, the choice of colors is different too. The Pixel 7a comes in Charcoal, Coral, Sea, and Snow, while the Pixel 7 is available in Obsidian, Lemongrass, and Snow.

It weighs 197g versus the 193g of the Pixel 7a. They are both a little on the heavier side for handsets of this size (the Samsung Galaxy S23 weighs just 168g, for example) but certainly nowhere near as bulky or unwieldy as the biggest models on the market. Despite the 7a’s plastic body, both phones feel pretty similar in the hand, especially since Google upgraded the Pixel 7a with a new anodized metal frame.

The centerpiece of the Pixel 7’s camera array is a large 50MP 1/1.31-inch sensor, the same one found on the Pro model. The 7a ups the megapixel count to 64MP but it’s a smaller 1/1.73-inch sensor, so it loses out on the large pixel sizes of its more expensive siblings. This makes a difference to the look of low-light images and detail capture. However, the Pixel 7a boasts a 13MP ultrawide with a broader 120-degree field of view than the 12MP, 144-degree camera in the Pixel 7. It’s the same story on the front, with a 13MP sensor, compared to the Pixel 7’s 10.8MP selfie cam. The numbers suggest positive things for the Pixel 7a, but we’ve taken some side-by-side snaps to double check.

Comparing a few pictures, we’ve concluded that the Pixel 7a’s main camera lacks some sharpness and can produce slightly punchier colors. The new ultrawide fits more into the shot and performs better in a broader range of scenarios thanks to autofocus capabilities that the 7 doesn’t have. However, it suffers from noise in lower light, particularly at the frame edges. That said, pictures from the two look pretty much like for like at a glance, with similar color and portrait processing available on both. We’re giving the nod to the more expensive Pixel here for it’s better zoom snaps, but most will still be plenty happy with the pictures taken on that 7a at this price point.

With essentially equivalent battery capacities, 4,385mAh for the Pixel 7a and 4,355mAh for the Pixel 7, an identical Tensor G2 processor, and roughly equivalent displays, we would expect battery life to be the same across both models. The Pixel 7 didn’t offer astounding battery life, but it could take most users through a full day, leaving lighter users with a little left in the tank. We’re looking at the same with the Pixel 7a.

That’s good because you’ll have to bring your own USB Power Delivery compatible plug if you want to charge these phones up. Google doesn’t include a charger with either model. Unlike the Pixel 7, you don’t need a USB PD PPS charger for the Pixel 7a. The Pixel 7a supports USB Power Delivery, which is capped at a rather low 18W of power. By comparison, the Pixel 7 charges at 20W with PPS or just 18W with regular USB PD, so essential Google has removed the fancier specification to keep costs down.

The Pixel 7 hits full in one hour and 41 minutes, while we tested the Pixel 7a at one hour and 46 minutes. Neither is particularly fast, but we have noted that the 7a can take even longer to charge when the phone is warm. We clocked it taking over two hours to full on at least one occasion.

Wireless charging, while a welcome addition to the Pixel 7a, is considerably slower still. Capped at just 7.5W, the phone takes an agonizing three hours or so to go from empty to full. Meanwhile, the Pixel 7 can pull 21W from the Google Pixel Stand (2nd gen), enabling wireless charging that is only a fraction slower than its wired charge times. If you thought the Pixel 7 was already a bit of a charging sloth, the 7a is really behind the fast charging curve.

Given the similarities we’ve come across while comparing the Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7, it’s no surprise that there isn’t much between their price tags either. Just $100 separates the model’s launch prices, but that does net you faster charging, superior build materials, and a marginally better camera setup with the Pixel 7. If you’re looking to save some cash by ditching the Pixel 7’s few extravagances, the Pixel 7a certainly succeeds at distilling Google’s smartphone formula down to just the essentials.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a vs. iPhone SE: Which cheap phone wins?
Publisher: Tom's Guide

Text: A Google Pixel 7a vs. iPhone SE comparison gives us a pretty clear view on the different approaches Google and Apple take toward low-cost phones. More importantly, it can help you decide which phone to get if you don't want to spend more than $500 on your next handset.

The iPhone SE 2022 certainly fits the definition of a low-cost phone. It's the least expensive device among the best iPhones, so you won't get some of the premium features you'll find on the iPhone 14 (and you'll definitely miss out on the higher-end capabilities of the iPhone 14 Pro). But you'll still find a phone that produces some pretty impressive photos despite its lone rear camera. Even more impressively, the iPhone SE can outperform many of the best Android phones on the market, thanks to a still-powerful chipset.

Google's Pixel 7a arrives a year after the iPhone SE's release, and it boasts a few premium features of its own, starting with AI-powered features supported by the Tensor G2 chipset inside the phone. The Pixel 7a also delivers outstanding photography in its own right, and Google has added a few premium features you wouldn't expect to see in a device that costs less than $500.

Which phone caught our eye when we compared these low-cost devices side by side? Here's how our Google Pixel 7a vs. iPhone SE face-off went down.

The Pixel 7a costs $499, a $50 price hike over what Google charged for the Pixel 6a when that phone debuted last year. While Google still kept the price under $500, the increase only widens the price gap between Google's midrange device and the iPhone SE. Apple charges $429 for the base model SE — a $70 discount off the Pixel 7a.

Then again, price differences can be misleading. That $429 iPhone SE only comes with 64GB of storage. To match the 128GB found in the Pixel 7a, you'll need to pay another $50. So, to get a comparable iPhone SE, you're only saving $20 off the Pixel 7a's price.

Pixel 7a deals can lower the cost of Google's phone, just as the best iPhone SE deals can drop the price there. At the end of the day, the iPhone enjoys the edge on price, though it's not as big an advantage as you'd imagine.

It's a tale of two designs when you look at the Pixel 7a and iPhone SE next to one another. The Pixel 7a adopts the same look as recent Google flagships, with a horizontal camera bar stretching across the back of the phone. From a distance, in fact, you'd be hard-pressed to spot the differences between a Pixel 7a and Pixel 7, though once you picked up both phones, the plastic back of the Pixel 7a would be a giveaway.

The nicest way to describe the iPhone SE's design is that Apple is embracing a vintage look. The SE resembles 2017's iPhone 8. That means no display notch, but also big bezels at the top and bottom of the 4.7-inch screen. It's a dated approach to phone design to say the least.

At least the iPhone SE can claim to be more durable than the Pixel 7a, as it uses a glass that's nearly as durable as the Ceramic Shield glass found on more expensive iPhones. Google uses the older Gorilla Glass 3 on its budget phone. Both phones promise IP67 water resistance, so they'll withstand a dunk in water.

Not only is the iPhone SE more compact than the Pixel 7a, it weighs nearly 2 ounces less as well. But the Pixel 7a offers more color options than the iPhone SE, which only comes in black, white or a [Product] Red variant. You'll find black and white (or Charcoal and Snow) Pixel 7a models, but Google gives you a choice of light blue and coral, too.

There's an obvious difference in screen size, with the Pixel 7a offering a 6.1-inch panel compared to that 4.7-inch iPhone SE screen. The iPhone features an LCD screen, too, in contrast to the OLED panel offered by the Pixel 7a.

That said, colors are remarkably similar, at least when the Pixel 7a is set to Natural mode. The iPhone SE captures a little bit more of the sRGB and DCI-P3 color gamuts, but only just. Switch the Pixel 6a to Adaptive mode and it captures a higher percentage of those gamuts. Its colors are more accurate in Adaptive, too, with a Delta-E rating of 0.05 to the iPhone SE's 0.21%. (Numbers closer to zero are better.)

The Pixel 7a enjoys two advantages over the iPhone SE when it comes to displays. First, it's brighter, hitting a maximum of 931 nits as measured by a light meter. The iPhone tops out at 596 nits. The Pixel 7a also supports a faster refresh rate of 90Hz while the iPhone SE is locked at 60Hz. This allows Google's phone to offer smother scrolling when the situation demands it.

It's not just the iPhone SE's design that's a throwback to several years ago; the phone's camera setup also hearkens back to olden times with a single 12MP rear camera to handle all your photographic needs. Some pretty powerful photo processing on the iPhone SE helps Apple's phone hold its own, but it's definitely at a hardware disadvantage.

Google seems to be headed in the opposite direction, though like Apple, its camera phones are distinguished by their strong computational photography powers. But Google also equips its budget phone with two lenses — a main camera and an ultrawide shooter.

In the case of the Pixel 7a, Google even upgraded the setup from past Pixel A phones so that the main camera relies on a 64MP sensor. A 13MP ultrawide angle camera makes up the remainder of the rear lenses on Google's phone.

A photo from indoors at night shows the benefits of the Pixel 7a's larger sensor. Because it lets in more light, it's able to capture more details and produce truer colors than you'll find in the iPhone SE shot.

I actually like what the iPhone SE has done with this photo of a Star Wars-themed dinner. But its colors are a bit muted compared to the Pixel 7a shot, where the blue milk looks much more blue, and the crumb-crisp coating on the filet of Porg — all right, all right, it's a chicken breast — is warmer and more inviting. As good as the iPhone SE photo is, the Pixel 7a's shot is just a bit better.

When testing the Pixel 7a, I've noticed it tends to favor darker colors and more shadows in its photos. That's very much in evidence in this grocery store shot featuring an array of different colored peppers. The yellow and orange peppers in particular have a darker cast than what you see in the iPhone SE photo, for example.

You could argue that the iPhone SE shot runs the risk of over-exposing that top row of peppers. But I also think the green and red peppers look brighter in the iPhone SE's photo, too, giving it the edge here over the Pixel 7a.

Both phones took a pretty decent shot of a decommissioned Navy fighter plane converted into a statue. The Pixel 7a has taken a more realistic shot, though I'm struck by the richer blue of the sky and the lush green grass of the iPhone SE image. Some heavy lifting is being done by the image processing on the iPhone SE, but it's a really pleasing effort.

Based on those three photos, you'd think the iPhone SE can keep pace with the Pixel 7a, and even beat it in some scenarios. You'd be correct, as we've always considered the iPhone SE to be one of the best camera phones for less than $500.

But you also have to consider what a camera phone can't do. The lack of an ultrawide lens on the iPhone SE means we can't compare it to the Pixel 7a's output from its 13MP ultrawide camera. And because the iPhone SE lacks support for a Night mode, its pictures in the dark are not going to measure up to what the Pixel 7a can do.

The iPhone SE tries its best in this shot of me on my porch enjoying a martini, with only ambient lighting from inside the house to illuminate the scene. This is one of the Pixel 7a's weaker efforts in my testing — my skin is unnaturally orange, and the martini itself is lost in the shadows. I'm in focus, but there's a lot of noise in the picture.

But the iPhone SE is robbed of any color, unnatural orange or otherwise. There's no attempt to pluck details out of the shadows. Even worse, I look pretty grainy in the iPhone SE shot. A little Night mode would go a long way here.

Matters improve for the Pixel 7a at least when we check in on some stuffed animals in a completely darkened scene. You can see the colors of each stuffed animal in the Pixel 7a shot, and even background details like flowers emerge from the darkness.

Everything's nearly pitch black in the iPhone SE photo. You can't even tell if that's one stuffie or two over Kermit's right shoulder, and what little color there is gets completely muted in the darkness.

It's a shame because in other scenarios, the iPhone SE's lone camera shows that you can do more with less. But because Apple won't support a Night mode for its cheap phone — presumably to get people to upgrade to more expensive models — it's impossible to recommend the iPhone SE as a camera phone over the more capable Pixel 7a.

Comparing Pixel 7a vs. iPhone SE benchmarks is as close to a no contest as you can get, though Google would argue that its not trying to compete with Apple phones in terms of raw performance. Rather, the Tensor G2 chip that powers the Pixel 7a focuses more on the silicon's Tensor Processing Unit and the on-device machine learning that can result from all that computational power. We'll discuss that in greater depth in the software section, since Tensor is all about the AI-driven experiences it can enable.

But that leaves the Pixel 7a at the mercy of the iPhone SE, which features the same A15 Bionic chipset found in the iPhone 13 lineup. (The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus also run on an A15 Bionic, but their version features an additional graphics core.) The Pixel 7a may be using the same silicon found in Google's Pixel 7 flagships, but the iPhone SE's older A15 can still out-muscle both.

The iPhone SE's score of 4,482 on Geekbench 5's multicore test is 46% better than the Pixel 7a's 3,065 result. The gap isn't as noticeable on 3DMark's Wild Life Unlimited graphics test, but the iPhone SE's 50 frames per second result is comfortably ahead of the 41.1 fps score produced by the Pixel 7a. When we used Adobe Premiere Rush to transcode a video on both phones, the iPhone SE beat the Pixel 7a's time by nearly 30 seconds.

The Pixel 7a is no performance slouch, though it does heat up noticeably when you play graphically intense games. Still, the iPhone SE easily out-performs it in every measurable way.

The iPhone SE's small size doesn't leave a lot of room for a big battery, and teardowns reveal that Apple is using a 2,018 mAh power pack in its cheapest phone. (An earlier version of this article listed the wrong battery size for the iPhone SE 2022 — we've corrected the error.) Even the power-efficient A15 Bionic is going to have a hard time squeezing a lot of life out of that, and our iPhone SE battery test result reflects that.

When we had Apple's phone surf the web continuously over cellular, it held out for 9 hours and 5 minutes before running out of power. That's about 50 minutes shorter than the average smartphone.

Armed with a 4,385 mAh, the Pixel 7a does quite a bit better on our battery test. It lasted 10 hours and 5 minutes, beating the iPhone by an hour and finishing just ahead of the average smartphone. That time came with the Pixel 7a's display set at a 60Hz refresh rate, which is the same as the iPhone SE's display. We're going to test the Pixel 7a with its adaptive refresh rate turned on; typically that feature tends to be more power-hungry, reducing performance on our battery test.

Neither phone charges particularly quickly. The Pixel 7a supports 18W wired charging speeds while the iPhone SE can charge at 20W. The Pixel 7a adds support for wireless charging, negating an advantage the iPhone held over other cheap phones.

Normally, any iPhone would enjoy a big software edge over an Android device, thanks to Apple's lengthy software support for its phones. iPhones tend to get five years of software support, which means that the iPhone SE 2022 will be able to support whatever version of iOS Apple releases in 2027. The Pixel 7a can only count on three Android OS updates, and one of those — Android 14 — is arriving later this year.

However, this is where the experiences powered by the Tensor G2 chipset inside the Pixel 7a really shine through. Like the Pixel 7 before it, the Pixel 7a is capable of a number of things you won't see on other mobile phones, including Apple's handsets.

If you've got photos where someone's face is a little blurry, the Pixel 7a's Photo Unblur feature uses AI to clear things up. The feature even works on photos shot by other devices — including the iPhone SE. Features like Direct My Call, which offer an on-screen menu of phone directories for 800-numbers, and Speaker Labels in the Pixel's Recorder app add a layer of intelligence you don't get from the iPhone's Siri assistant.

The iPhone SE gives you a low-cost entry point into the outstanding iOS ecosystem. But as nice as that is, the Tensor-powered features available to Pixel 7a owners are just a little bit more impressive.

The iPhone SE had better thank its A15 Bionic silicon. Because without the dominant performance driven by that chipset — not to mention the photo processing features it supports — the Pixel 7a would blow away Apple's cheapest phone. As it stands, the Google Pixel 7a vs. iPhone SE face-off is merely convincing win for Google's device instead of an overwhelming one.

The iPhone SE's low price, powerful processor and impressive camera keep it in the conversation for best cheap phones. But that dated design and subpar battery life leave plenty of space for a better phone to come along.

That better phone is the Pixel 7a. We love the fact that it offers a fast-refreshing display, wireless charging and the same Tensor chipset as Google's current flagship without costing more than $500. Google's stellar cameras remain a reason to consider its smartphones, but the Pixel 7a adds a lot more to the story.

Softtitle: The Google Pixel 7a looks sturdier than its Pro sibling in this durability test

Text: * The Google Pixel 7a fared well in a durability test.

* However, it sustained a few scratches on its plastic back panel.

The Google Pixel 7a has a lot going for it when it comes to hardware, and a new durability test by YouTuber Zack Nelson shows that it has an equally solid build quality and can withstand a lot of abuse.

If you’re worried that Google's latest mid-range phone looks a little on the fragile side for its price, the torture video below by the JerryRigEverything channel will put your mind at ease. The phone withstood being scratched with a razor blade, bent multiple times, and even having its screen burned with a lighter.

Nelson has built a reputation for putting every new smartphone across various price categories through the ringer to see what kind of abuse it can endure. And after subjecting the Pixel 7a to the worst torture a phone can possibly go through, the results did inspire much confidence.

When scratching its screen with a set of Mohs hardness picks, the handset began to show signs of damage at level 6, with deeper ruts appearing at level 7. This means that the screen scratches at the same level as many of the flagship Android phones, such as the Pixel 7 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.

The screen also warped when a lighter was held to it, although it did recover after a short while. One area that's particularly concerning in Nelson's antics was the bend test, not only because it’s stressful to watch someone try to snap a smartphone regardless of price. The fear was that the protruding camera bar would split the phone in half, especially with the Pixel 7a.

It turns out those concerns were baseless, with the phone surviving the bend test unscathed. That was not the case for the pricey Pixel 7 Pro (which costs at least $900), whose durability faced a serious threat. This raised serious concerns regarding its resistance to everyday wear and tear over the long term.

On the other hand, the Pixel 7a exhibited impressive durability for a phone that costs only $500. It shows that Google has put a lot of thought into making the Pixel 7a a durable device that can withstand the rigors of everyday use.

As for the rest of the phone, Nelson had no trouble scratching through the Pixel 7a's entirely plastic rear panel with a box cutter.

When purchasing a new smartphone, most people want to ensure that the device will withstand daily wear and tear. You won't have any issues with the Pixel 7a in this regard. Having said that, you should still get one of the best cases for the Pixel 7a because its plastic back panel is easily scratched with a razor blade.

Text: The Pixel 7a brings many of the flagship Pixel 7's features to what should be a more budget-friendly device, including camera features like Unblur, Magic Eraser, and other Tensor 2-powered options. Cons        The Google Pixel 4a, one of the last Nexus-like devices Google ever made, offered a fantastic camera, great performance, and a solid package for a budget-friendly price.

Pros   Support for up to Android 13   Cons  No official support for Android 14

ANDROIDPOLICE VIDEO OF THE DAYSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT

The Google Pixel 4a was one of the last devices to sport Google's old style of making phones, with the device looking more akin to its older Nexus devices. On top of that, it offered some of the best camera features of any Pixel to date, making it a difficult phone to let go of. Now that Google has announced the Pixel 7a, it may be time to finally trade in that old, iconic Google look for a more refined experience. But new doesn't always mean better, so how do these two devices stack up? Let's take a look.

When it launched, the Pixel 4a was one of the best Android phones that Google had ever released, and it did a lot to further the company’s smartphone camera efforts; plus, it was really easy to get your hands on. With three years of service behind it, the Pixel 4a has become much more difficult to get your hands on. The device can still be found on several merchant websites like Amazon, but it still sports a price tag of $399, making it the same price as newer hardware from several other competitors.

That price tag becomes even harder to swallow when you compare it to the $499 starting price of the Pixel 7a, Google’s newest budget-friendly device. Now, the cost of the Pixel 7a isn’t as low as many would have liked to see it, especially with the Pixel 7 normally starting at just $599. Still, the Pixel 7a is a solid deal, especially when you consider that it will be guaranteed to receive new updates over the next couple of years.

As for specs, it’s hard for the Pixel 4a to keep up with the updated hardware found in the Pixel 7a. While the camera in the Pixel 4a still delivers great photographs, it doesn’t take full advantage of all the extra features that Google Tensor makes possible.

The designs of the Pixel 4a and Pixel 7a couldn’t be any more different. The Pixel 4a is more akin to Google’s old-school Nexus devices, which were originally known for their stylish yet basic looks. On the other hand, the Pixel 7a continues Google’s new design style of going for clean aesthetics that make it a standout device, no matter whose hand it is in.

Of course, other major differences in the design include the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack on the Pixel 7a. The Pixel 4a still offers a headphone jack, which some users may not want to part with just yet. Aside from that, their designs are somewhat similar, at least as far as the material goes. The Pixel 7a is made up of a 3D thermoformed composite with a tactile alloy frame, while the Pixel 4a is housed in a plastic material, which means both devices require a case to properly protect them from drops and scratches.

The Pixel 4a is also slightly smaller at just 5.8 inches compared to the Pixel 7a’s 6.1 inches. Unfortunately, neither device comes equipped with expandable memory, so you’ll be stuck with whatever internal storage you have in the phone by default.

Their styles are very different, though some similarities exist. If you want to stick with a more basic design, and take advantage of the headphone jack included in the Pixel 4a, then upgrading isn’t the most viable option, at least when choosing between these two devices. However, the cleaner look and feel of the Pixel 7a, along with the addition of face unlock and the improved body, make it a more refined device for those who want to stand out a bit more.

Despite three years of upgrades between them, the Pixel 4a and Pixel 7a offer similar displays. Both panels are OLED and offer similar resolutions. The Pixel 4a sports a 2340 × 1080 pixel display that runs at 60hz. The Pixel 7a shows a 2400 × 1080 display, making it slightly bigger. It also runs at 90hz, so the refresh rate will be smoother on the Pixel 7a.

Both devices feature Corning Gorilla Glass 3 panels, offering similar protection against fingerprints, scratches, and other wear and tear. Both also take advantage of HDR support, allowing for vibrant and beautiful visuals when watching videos and looking at photos.

The display isn’t where either of these devices outshines the other. No matter which phone you decide to stick with, you’ll have a similar experience — though it is difficult to write off the higher refresh rate of the Pixel 7a, which is very useful when playing mobile games or enjoying certain applications.

If you were expecting the Google Pixel 7a and Pixel 4a to be massively different, then the software isn’t the place to look. Each device is made by Google, which means you can expect a smooth and clean Android experience on both. However, the Pixel 4a is no longer guaranteed to receive future Android updates, which means there could be some big differences coming into play once Android 14 releases.

Currently, the newest version of Android supported by the Pixel 4a is Android 13. Unlike the Pixel 4a, the 7a is guaranteed to continue receiving Android updates for a few years, making it the better device for long-term users who don’t want to worry about becoming outdated for the next few years. The Pixel 4a is still a very solid phone, though its lack of guaranteed updates in the coming years will soon leave it outdated and struggling to keep up.

The Pixel 4a was never top-of-the-line for performance, and its budget-friendly hardware is even more noticeable after three years. It’s equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G paired with an Adreno 618 GPU. This system chip isn’t terrible by any means, but it definitely struggles to keep up during more intensive usage, especially if you’re multitasking.

The Pixel 7a’s performance is more along the lines of what you’d expect from a flagship device, as it sports the same processor found in Google’s more expensive flagship Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. Overall, both devices will operate fairly smoothly, though the Tensor 2 will give you access to even more features that Google has spent the past few years updating and improving.

The Pixel 7a has a larger battery than the Pixel 4a, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re going to see a lot of difference in daily usage and battery drain. The Pixel 4a’s battery is just 3140 mAh compared to the Pixel 7a’s 4385 mAh battery. With that extra battery capacity, you should expect some clear upgrades, but the Pixel 4a has always had a solid battery, especially with all of Google’s software tweaks.

That’s still apparent three years later, even though the increased capacity of the Pixel 7a and the continued tweaking of Google’s systems in the Android operating system mean that it can prioritize using the battery for what you need more precisely. Still, battery life is a tough one to judge. Ultimately, the Pixel 7a is the winner here, thanks to its increased capacity and the introduction of wireless charging in the A-series for the first time.

The Pixel 4a was very well known for its camera when the phone released in 2020, and it’s still a great smartphone camera today. However, the Pixel 7a offers users upgraded options, including a 64 MP Quad Bayer wide camera and a 13 MP ultrawide camera. All of that stacks well with the machine learning and AI systems that Google has built into Tensor, including the Magic Eraser tool, Unblur, and other features.

While both phones include solid features out of the box, the machine-learning elements make them truly stand out above the rest of the options out there; plus, the Pixel 7a delivers beautiful photos with tons of settings and options that you can tweak to ensure you always snap the best photo or video possible. The Pixel 7a also offers improved video recording, with options for 4K recording at 30 and 60 FPS compared to the Pixel 4a’s locked 30 FPS recording on 4K videos.

Of course, you can’t forget the front-facing camera. The Pixel 4a’s 8 MP still stands up well, but when placed side-by-side with the Pixel 7a’s 13 MP, it just doesn’t hold up as well, especially with Tensor’s additional camera features.

If you’ve been rocking the Google Pixel 4a and loving it, it might not be a bad idea to go ahead and upgrade to the new Pixel 7a just for the updated features and the guaranteed updates to come. You’ll still get that same clean Android software you love but with a ton of upgraded features that will ultimately make your life a lot easier.

The Pixel 7a brings many of the flagship Pixel 7's features to what should be a more budget-friendly device, including camera features like Unblur, Magic Eraser, and other Tensor 2-powered options.  $499  at Amazon $499 at Google Store $449 at Best Buy

The Google Pixel 4a is a great device, especially if you like the old-school Nexus look on your Pixel. However, Google's updates to the Pixel devices over the years have helped make the Pixel 7a an even better device, with a stronger battery, wireless charging, and a slew of other flagship features for a mid-range price. But, if you're not ready to say goodbye to the old-school Nexus feel, the Pixel 4a still has plenty of life to offer.

A great device that's starting to show its ageThe Google Pixel 4a was one of the last Nexus-like devices Google ever made, and it offered a fantastic camera, great performance, and a solid package for a budget-friendly price. It's a bit harder to get your hands on now, however.

You don't need a paternity test to determine the Pixel 7a's lineage, it proudly joins the ranks of the Pixel 7 Pro and the Pixel 7. The trio now has the same design language, the same chipset, and mostly the same software feature set, so there's one question that's probably on everyone's mind. Is the Pixel 7a actually the best new Pixel, the one to get instead of the more posh Pixel 7 and Pixe 7 Pro sibs? After using one for roughly a week, I'm convinced that this could actually be the case here, folks. Yes, there are some corners cut here and there, and you will find some "premium" features on the rest of the Google flagships, but at the end of the day, the Pixel 7a provides mostly the same user experience. And it costs less.

More expensive than its predecessor

Buy the Google Pixel 7a from Amazon with a discount!

The new budget Google Pixel 7a champ can be yours directly from Amazon at a cool $50 discount. The offer comes in the form of a gift card that can be used on products sold at Amazon.

Best Buy knocks $50 off the Pixel 7a price!

If you get the new Pixel 7a over at Best Buy, the retailer will give you a discount in the form of a gift card you can use towards the purchase of a Pixel 7a case or anything else your soul desires from its extensive product catalog.

Sо, what's the damage? Well, the 'affordable' Pixel has become more expensive and carry a $499 price tag in the US. That hike was anticipated, as it makes the Pixel 7a a slightly worse deal than its predecessor, which started at $449 (though it has since dropped to $349). Should you get the Pixel 6a instead of the new phone? It could offer better value, but the Pixel 7a is definitely the better phone overall. More on that in our dedicated Pixel 7a versus Pixel 6a review. What’s new about the deviceInside the Pixel 7a box, you'll find a USB Type-C to USB Type-C cable (but no charger), A USB Type-A to USB Type-C adapter, a SIM ejector pin, and the usual booklets. Oh, and you should also find a Pixel 7a there, otherwise count yourself unlucky and ask for a refund ASAP. The Pixel 7a closely follows into the footsteps of the Pixel 7 series and definitely looks and feels like it belongs to Google's latest flagship series. It has a more pronounced rear camera strip, which Google calls "3D metal visor", which now neatly links up with the anodized aluminum frame. This definitely makes for a more coherent and modern look, though I'd lie if I say I wouldn't miss the understated black strip of the Pixel 6 era. However, the camera strip still attracts pocket lint and debris like crazy, not to mention that the plastic back of the phone is a fingerprint magnet in the purest sense of the term. As far as build quality goes, there are some minor issues on the Pixel 7a: the backplate forms a slightly noticeably lip where it links up with the side frame, which isn't a big deal, but definitely triggered my OCD and doesn't really feel so nice in the hand. The Pixel 6a, for example, doesn't have such an issue and feels better in the palm. The Pixel 7a is heavier than the Pixel 6a, but you are unlikely to notice the difference. That's regardless of the predominantly plastic build, which has allowed for wireless charging. Albeit painfully slow, it's still nice to have on an affordable Pixel Much to the chagrin of many, the Pixel 7a does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack. It's okay, the Pixel 6a didn't have one either, so it's time to abandon all hope that Google will bring back the classic audio interface on its phones ever again.

And, just like the Pixel 6a, the Pixel 7a proudly wears an IP67 certification as a badge of honor, making it dust- and water-proof. This means that the phone is protected against prolonged exposure to dust and can survive brief contact with water in up to 3ft (1m) in depth. What's the situation with the Pixel 7a colors? Keeping up with the tradition to come up with playful names and hues for its devices, Google has both classic and playful colorways: Charcoal (black), Snow (white), Sea (pale blue), and Coral. Decent selection that could match the taste of a wide selection of people. I had the pleasure of reviewing the Charcoal version of the phone, which is dark grey in person and looks classy and understated. The Pixel 7a retains the 6.1-inch display of the Pixel 6a with mostly the same specs, but upgrades a vital hardware specification–– the refresh rate. Welcome to the 90Hz club, Pixel 7a!The interface is much smoother as a result, leaving the impression of being much faster than the Pixel 6a, for example, though in real-life scenarios there might not be any significant performance differences between the two phones. Having a 90Hz screen is definitely great to have on an affordable Pixel. The phone tones the refresh down to 60Hz when displaying static content (like photos), but will immediately ramp it up to 90Hz when you touch the display. Aside from that, the Pixel 7a has that 6.1-inch OLED FHD+ display. The bezels are slightly thicker than what we saw on the Pixel 6a, but you will get used to them in no time. From a quality perspective, I doubt anyone could be disappointed with what the Pixel 7a has to offer. It achieves very good maximum brightness under the correct ambient lighting conditions, though it's a bit conservative and slow to amp up the brightness even in broad daylight, so an iPhone or a Galaxy will react to the changes quicker. Color rendition is also excellent on the Pixel 7a, and can be either true-to-life in the Natural mode or much livelier in the default Adaptive screen mode. Viewing angles are great as well. Overall, it's a very good display.

Something promising looming on the horizon

Gone is the ol' reliable" IMX363 camera sensor, the Pixel 7a boasts a main camera with the Sony IMX787 64MP camera sensor, though you will hardly ever be able to make use of its full resolution. Google use quad-pixel binning with the Pixel 7a, combining four pixels into one, thus outputting 16MP photos. Aside from sounding cool, pixel-binning delivers more detailed photos as it can help the sensor soak in more light. That's great for low-light image quality, too. At the same time, the ultra-wide snapper is also getting a camera sensor change, as the Pixel 7a will employ the 13MP Sony IMX712 sensor for its ultra-wide camera. As a refresher, the Pixel 6a and many previous Pixels utilized the 12MP Sony IMX386 ultra-wide sensor. Up front, we have another 13MP selfie camera. Enough specs and boring talk, let's see how the new camera setup fares!The Pixel is extremely capable when the lighting is sufficient. I love the natural yet lively color reproduction, the tack-sharp details, and great dynamics that the Pixel 7a delivers. Definitely on the same level as the Pixel 7, which is great, as you get the same unmistakable signature camera quality on a tighter budget!At night, true to its family legacy,  the Pixel 7a is a very strong contender. Detail is nice across the board, with correct color rendition, but just the tiniest bit of noise in the darkest areas of a given image. If zooming is important to you, look past the Pixel 7a. It doesn't come with a telephoto lens, so you're stuck home with digital zoom. Google boasts that Super Res Zoom is part of the Pixel 7a's arsenal, and while the 2X preset in the camera app provides decent results, anything past that is hardly usable. Not that you will have a lot of room to cover––the Pixel 7a makes out at 8X digital zoom, but anything past 2X is hardly usable.   When it comes to portraits, the Pixel 7a does a very good job at isolating the subject from the background. Sure, some strands of hair will probably fall victims to the algorithm, but that's normal. Some issues may be expected if the background is on the same plane as your subject, as evident in the portrait with the flowers. Generally though, portraits are lovely, with a moody appearance that embodies that classic Pixel look. The Pixel 7a's brand-new ultra-wide camera is wider than the one on the Pixel 6a. That's great! It makes the camera that much more usable in capturing, well, ultra-wide scenes. Selfies delivered by the 13MP selfie camera are very decent, with more than acceptable level of detail and lovely color rendition, as well as pleasing facial colors. Those are definitely selfies you might want to upload on social media, if you still do that on the regular. When it comes to video, the Pixel 7a will do a fine job, provided that there's ample light and you don't have to engage the stabilization often. Videos appear noisy at low light, you might have some issues with the Pixel 7a. Even though the main camera is stabilized and you have a few different stabilization modes to choose from, you might still experience undesirable jitter in your videos, so the Pixel 7a is definitely not at flagship level when it comes to stabilization. Otherwise, 4K videos at either 30 or 60 fps are perfectly fine and give you a lot of leeway for your post-processing endeavors. The Pixel 7a is powered by the flagship-grade Tensor G2 chipset, which debuted alongside Google's Pixel 7 series in late 2022. The Tensor G2 is mostly similar to its predecessor in terms of architecture: it is built on a 5nm manufacturing process and comes with a  configuration; dual high-performance ARM Cortex-X1 cores, two mid-range Cortex-A78 cores, and finally, quad Cortex-A55 efficiency cores. The difference between the Tensor G2 and G1 is mainly found in the mid-range cores, which were the slightly slower Cortex-A76 on the Tensor G1.It's not at all surprising that the Pixel 7a achieves similar synthetic benchmark results as the Pixel 7 and the Pixel 7 Pro, though not that far away from the previous generation Pixels as well. But we should always remember that the Tensor chipset was never about raw performance, it's a platform that enables improved on-device artificial intelligence and machine learning, both of which become more and more important in this day and age.

In terms of real-life usage, the Pixel 7a is quite capable and performs well. The only whiff of a serious stutter only revealed itself when navigating through Minecraft's menu interface, but once in-game, the phone performs as you'd expect, maintaining a near constant 90fps. The phone gets warm during intense gameplay, but nothing too excessive or too unpleasant to handle, as the mostly plastic back insulates from the accumulated heat.

The Pixel 7a comes with 8GB of RAM, a very decent bump of 2GB extra in comparison with the Pixel 6a, and on par with many contemporary flagships. Definitely a surprising (to me) spec bump that makes the Pixel 7a way more future-proof. In all honesty, Google could have kept the RAM at 6GB, and probably nobody would have objected. As far as storage is concerned, 128GB of native storage is what we get on the Pixel 7a, of course with no extra hardware expansion options. Google is unlikely to offer another storage variant, so you will probably need to rely on a cloud-based storage option at some point in time. A Google One subscription is your best bet here, not only due to the extra cloud storage you get, but also thanks to the host of additional software services and features that will play extremely nice with your Pixel phone.

Just like the Pixel 6a and most recent Pixels, the Pixel 7a is a 5G-capable device, with both sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G support. This means that you will be able to benefit from the low-band and high-band 5G speeds on Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T.

Although Android 14 is technically sort of official as it's currently available as a beta for eligible Pixel phones, the upcoming Android update will officially arrive to the Pixel 7a in August 2023. The Pixel 7a ships with Android 13 out of the box.The Pixel 7a will receive three years of major software updates as well as five years of security patches. This means that Pixel 7a users will have the one-in-a-lifetime pleasure of experiencing Android 14, Android 15, and Android 16 earlier than most other Android users. Meanwhile, your phone will be secure up to 2028. Of course, the appeal of the Pixel is the vanilla software on board that's chock full of excellent Google services and features. Functionalities like Clear Calling, Voice Message Transcription, Call Screening, Assistant Voice Typing, and all the smarts of the Google Assistant are part of the Pixel 7a's feature roster. I just love how good the Pixel is when used heavily in conjunction with Google's services. Being a heavy Google user myself, usually juggling between at least two Google profiles daily, using a Pixel usually takes away a lot of stress and makes the experience more pleasant than usual. Shocking, I know, but most Android devices out there generally lack the same level of detail and amount of polish when it comes to accommodating your own The Pixel 7a comes with a 4,385mAh battery, which is technically slightly less than the 4,410mAh one that was found inside the Pixel 6a, but the Pixel 7a has a slightly more capable chipset, so it should be more efficient, at least in theory. In practice, the Pixel 7a battery life is more than decent. With my specific usage, which involves lots of multitasking between apps, reading, and some social media, the Pixel 7a routinely ended the day with around 30 to 40% of battery left. However, heavier usage and gaming especially might take a very serious toll on the phone's battery life and force you to seek out a wall charger prematurely. If you're an enthusiastic mobile gamer, the Pixel 7a is probably not the perfect phone for you. When it comes to our custom battery benchmark tests, the Pixel 7a fares mostly similar to the Pixel 7 and surpasses the Pixel 6a in some regards. In our dedicated video playback battery test, which had the Pixel 7a loop through a playlist of videos with the brightness set at 200 nits, the new trooper lasted for 9 hours and 7 minutes, which is a great result if watching videos is a regular daily activity for you. Meanwhile, in our web browsing test that simulates a regular web browsing, the Pixel 7a lasted for 15 hours and 27 minutes, surpassing both the Pixel 6a and the Pixel 7. Finally, our gaming test proved to be a bit too taxing for Google's new phone, as it endured for just 4 hours and 20 minutes (consistent with the Pixel 7's mostly similar result of 4 hours and 43 minutes in the same test).

When it comes to charging, the Pixel 7a supports 18W wired and 7.5W wireless charging, a first on an affordable Pixel phone. The phone charges slowly: it takes two hours to charge it from 0 to 100% with Google's own 30W USB-C wall adapter. The 7.5W wireless charging should only be used overnight, as it's paaaaaaainfully slow.With two stereo speakers on board, the Pixel 7a produces a very decent soundstage that doesn't shine with deep base or super-clear highs, but delivers strong and punchy sound with bright mids. The iPhone 14 delivers clearer high frequencies, but lacks the same prowess in the mids; while the iPhone sounds like a phone, the Pixel 7a delivers an audio experience similar to a not-too-shabby smart speaker. In comparison with the Galaxy A54, the Samsung phone is both quieter and not as fun to listen to. The haptics are decent, but nothing to really write home about. Mostly unchanged from the Pixel 6a, the Pixel 7a delivers exact vibrations that aren't too strong, but aren't too mushy either.

The Pixel 7a joins the ranks of the Pixel 7 and the Pixel 7 Pro, which were announced back in late 2022. Check out their respective reviews by following any of the links below:The fresh new Galaxy A54 5G is one of the more serious Pixel 7a competitors at the same price point. The fresh Samsung upper mid-range phone comes with a 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display, FHD+ resolution, smoother 120Hz refresh rate, as well as 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a microSD card slot for some storage expansion.

Powered by the Exynos 1380 chipset, this one has a triple camera setup, consisting of a wide, ultra-wide, and macro camera. There's also a 5,000mAh battery with 25W wired charging, but no wireless charging. Prices for this one start at $450, so definitely in the ballpark of the Pixel 7a.

But guess what, the Pixel 7 itself is also a very decent alternative of the Pixel 7a. With a slightly higher price tag, but a mostly similar camera setup and image quality, as well as even more native storage if you pay $100 more,  available with 256GB of storage, it could be a noteworthy alternative that should be considered. Overall, the Pixel 7a is a more than a decent phone with very decent improvements over the Pixel 6a. Should you upgrade from last year's affordable Pixel? No. You shouldn't, just save your money. But if you're coming from an older Pixel, say, a Pixel 4a or a Pixel 5, the the Pixel 7a is a very, very, very lucrative and appealing offer. It brings the best of Google in a user-friendly and affordable package that makes.

If you don't need some of the exclusive flagship features of the pricier Pixels, then this stock Android champ is certainly the phone to get. After all, it has it all, the AI/ML chops of the larger Pixels, a capable camera with many software features, a super compact size in comparison with your average Android phone, and finally, a $500 price tag that is very sensible.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a review: If déjà vu were a smartphone

Text: This year's A-series is more like its flagship counterpart than ever before — for better and for worse

This year's A-series is more like its flagship counterpart than ever before — for better and for worse

Believe it or not, Google's A-series has only been around for four generations now. Kicking off in 2019 as a low-cost alternative to the Pixel 3 series, the company's midrange smartphones have always provided consistently impressive experiences, even in years when the mainline devices floundered or failed to meet their stated goals. With the Pixel 7a, Google is attempting to pull off something even more impressive: bringing 85 percent of the Pixel 7 experience for just 85 percent of its original cost.

ANDROIDPOLICE VIDEO OF THE DAYSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT

More than last year's Pixel 6a, this phone feels like it's designed to replace its namesake. But in trying to deliver as much of the mainline experience as possible, the A-series seems to be struggling to find an identity. In fact, just four years into its midrange experiment, it feels like Google might've lost the plot on what made this series of smartphones so special.

The Pixel 7a is Google's most advanced A-series device yet, nearly matching the Pixel 7 spec-for-spec. But with those extra features comes a price hike up to $500, and combined with some subpar battery life, it could be the first A-series Pixel device not worth your money. Pros  Some nice quality-of-life improvements, like 90Hz and wireless charging    Cons Battery life is purely average, even in the best of cases Those quality-of-life improvements come with their own caveats Price hike puts it within spitting distance of the Pixel 7     $499  at Amazon $499 at Google Store $449 at Best Buy

The Pixel 7a is available in a whopping seventeen countries this year, including the US, Canada, Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, and the UK.

As with previous launches in the US, it's available on all three carriers, their respective MVNOs, and — of course — Google Fi. You can also purchase the Pixel 7a unlocked following its I/O announcement at the retailer of your choice, though the coral colorway is a Google Store exclusive. If you're looking for a mmWave-supported model, you'll need to buy through Verizon — and you'll need to pony up some extra cash. Otherwise, the Pixel 7a is available in one configuration: 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for $500.

I've already explored my thoughts about this $50 price hike back when the Pixel 7a was but another phone churning through the rumor mill, so I'll leave it at this: I think Google's current smartphone lineup places the 7a in a weird spot. With the Pixel 6a hanging on at $350 and the Pixel 7 available for just $100 more than this model, I think it's easy to imagine a shopper either sacrificing more to save some cash or spending a few extra bucks to get a more premium experience. And this is assuming none of these phones are on sale, which, you know, they will be.

Frankly, this $500 price tag feels like a precursor to a $700 Pixel 8 later this year, which will undoubtedly give this device a bit more breathing room in the market. But assuming we stick to the usual October launch window, that's still five months away, and we can only judge the Pixel 7a by what it is today.

Apologies to anyone who likes to play "spot the Android phone" when they're out at a bar — myself included — but the Pixel 7a is about to make your favorite game a lot more difficult. Aside from its two new color choices (a subdued pastel blue and a vibrant orange-y coral), Google's latest midrange phone looks a hell of a lot like the Pixel 7, and it's only once you examine it up close (preferably with its older brother nearby) that you notice some of the tweaks.

Let's start with some obvious changes. Upfront, the Pixel 7a's bezels match what we've seen on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6a before it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and in day-to-day use, you do get used to them. But compared to other modern phones, it's definitely worth calling out.

Still, looking at the chassis overall, it's just a tad shorter, narrower, and thicker than last year's $600 flagship, and I think that's a good thing. The current Pixel design language is divisive, there's no doubt about that, but personally, I quite like it. The Pixel 7a isn't a "small" phone, but it does fit quite nicely into my hand, and even just a few grams difference is enough for it to feel lighter in my pocket.

To me, the most noticeable change is the camera bar. Google has once again coated it in a matte aluminum finish, which looks far more premium than the exposed glass used throughout the Pixel 6 series. But the camera bar is also much, much thinner than what's on the Pixel 7, and honestly, I really prefer that.

I know this is a consequence of using smaller sensors — and thereby needing less space — but honestly, it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make for the best implementation of the camera bar yet. The Pixel 7, in retrospect, looks borderline dated with its chonky visor.

A closer look reveals some more minute changes, things that — personally — I think are worth pointing out, even if you'd need both phones nearby to notice them. Google has swapped out the metallic buttons on the Pixel 7 for a matte finish on both the power button and the volume rocker, similar to what's on the bigger Pro model. Still, they feel just as clicky as before, and, bonus, they're in my preferred order.

Second, the camera bar no longer blends perfectly into the frame, as it does on the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro. This definitely diminishes the overall look of the phone, making it look cheaper and less like a single solid brick. Then again, it is cheaper, so it's hard to complain too much here.

Third, Google is once again relying on plastic for the back of the Pixel 7a, rather than opting for glossy glass. Personally, it's a nearly imperceptible difference in feel alone. It picks up just as much oil and grease from your hands as if it were glass, so if that bothers you, opt for a lighter color like white or blue. I'd love for Google to make the swap back to matte materials, but at this point, it's feeling increasingly hopeless.

It's a subtle change, but the Pixel 7a's camera bar seam stands out once you notice it.

On the Android Police podcast — which you should absolutely subscribe to if you haven't already — former AP EIC (and still my boss) Daniel Bader and I have had a recurring spat surrounding the Pixel 7's display. Basically, he thinks it sucks, and I think it's totally fine. Although I have yet to check in with his current Pixel 7a experience, I'm starting to feel a kinship with him over his display takes, as I'm not a huge fan of the panel Google is using here.

It's not an outright disaster, of course. It gets bright enough in direct sunlight to see without much of an issue, and outside of some rainbow-colored distortion, its viewing angles are basically fine. I can't imagine anyone will complain too much about this screen in a vacuum, but placed next to the Pixel 7, I think it's a bit of a step-down. At the same brightness level, last year's $600 flagship just looks brighter, especially when set in dark mode.

Of course, the big display change this year is an upgrade to 90Hz, matching what's offered on the Pixel 7 while not quite reaching the 120Hz heights of rivals from Samsung and OnePlus. While I find 60Hz panels pretty distracting these days, I have a harder time telling the difference between 90Hz and 120Hz, so I find Google's cost-cutting compromise here totally sound. The whole phone feels snappier once it's running at 90Hz, which makes its default state all the more baffling.

Google made the decision to ship the Pixel 7a with Smooth Display off, with a spokesperson telling me it's a battery-saving measure. I'll have plenty to say about the battery life on this phone later on, but frankly, I think keeping it disabled by default under an obscure setting all but guarantees the vast majority of Pixel 7a owners will never take full advantage of this screen, and frankly, that's a bummer.

Other hardware and what's in the box

The Pixel 7 series — particularly the Pixel 7 Pro — really impressed me with its haptics, and while the 7a is definitely a step down from Google's high mark of excellence, it's a world above what $500 would get you just a few years ago. From scrolling through recent apps to typing on Gboard, I don't think anyone will be disappointed with the haptic feedback presented here.

I'm less impressed with the speakers. The quality is totally fine — good, even — but I found it sounded a little too quiet for my liking, even on max volume. I'm chalking this down to the weak earpiece speaker; cover up the bottom-firing cutout and you'll be surprised how tinny and quiet the sound gets. This is far from a problem exclusive to this phone, but it's still worth calling out. Likewise, this can also throw the sound balance off, something I immediately noticed while watching the latest Oppenheimer trailer.

I'm sure plenty of potential buyers will have questions about the fingerprint sensor and the modem's performance in the Pixel 7a. Frankly, my experience here matches what I've seen on the Pixel 7. I wouldn't call the fingerprint sensor blazing fast, but it's on par with what Google included in its flagships last year, and paired with face unlock built into the front-facing camera, unlocking the 7a is quick and simple.

That said, AP's Google editor Manuel Vonau experienced some major fingerprint sensor issues, with the device unable to unlock using any of the four sensors registered in settings. This problem popped up just before our review went live, so we'll returning to explore it in later updates.

I haven't noticed any network issues on my T-Mobile-based MVNO, but again, I didn't face any issues on the Pixel 7 Pro last fall. Your mileage may vary, but I think the relative silence surrounding both of these issues in the past six months proves that Google ironed out some of the kinks when compared to Pixel 6-series hardware.

Google's first-party cases are as bad as usual, especially around the power and volume buttons — I recommend looking elsewhere.

As for what's in the box, well, it's a modern smartphone. You'll find a USB-C to USB-C cable, a USB-A to USB-C adapter, a SIM tool, and the usual assortment of paperwork. No charger, no headphone adapter, no first-party case.

While Google usually relies on its flagship smartphones to present our first real glimpse at the future of Android, the Pixel 7a arrives a few months before Android 14 is set to launch. As such, the software experience here is basically unchanged from what you'd expect on any modern Pixel phone. Personally, I really like Google's approach to software. It provides just enough customization for my home screen to feel unique, while also automating or eliminating some of the more headache-inducing features found on other smartphones.

All of the software tricks and tweaks I loved on the Pixel 7 are here. The Recorder app remains second to none, Google's suite of call-enhancing tools are a godsend anytime I have to place a phone call — even if I still can't hear a difference when using Clear Calling — and I continue to beg for anyone in the industry to copy the Now Playing tool that displays ambient songs on your lock screen automatically. Likewise, the Pixel-exclusive options for cleaning up photos, including Photo Unblur, remain great, even if they'll likely continue to make their way to Google One subscribers after an exclusivity period.

Like other Pixels, the 7a will get three major OS upgrades in its lifespan, starting with Android 14 later this summer. Google should really work on matching Samsung's policy, but at the very least, five years of security patches should keep fans happy with their purchase for years to come.

Despite running on a Tensor G2 SoC — the same chipset found in the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro — I ran into some really odd performance hiccups that seemed to spawn from performing a data transfer from another phone (see the battery life section for more info). During my initial time with the phone, auto-rotate was a full beat slower than the Pixel 7, and you could really feel it in regular use. Enabling 90Hz usually keeps things at a consistently smooth frame rate, but occasionally, unlocking the screen or quickly swiping between home screens causes noticeable drops. And at one point, I had YouTube and Telegram crash back-to-back on me within seconds.

Performing a factory reset with a clean install seemed to iron out these issues; even auto-rotate is back to feeling as fast as you'd expect. This isn't an excuse so much as an explanation; frankly, the phone should've worked correctly out of the box.

Also, this might go without saying at this point, but Tensor chips run hot, and the Pixel 7a is no exception. As with the rest of the Pixel 7-series, the 7a would routinely get warm to the touch during regular use. You'd expect some heat from gaming or extended 4K video recording, but Tensor also fails to stay cool during web browsing or scrolling through Instagram. This isn't a problem for phones running on Qualcomm's newest silicon, and I think it's something that Google needs to figure out ahead of the Pixel 8 later this year.

Unlike in previous years, Google has turned to all-new camera hardware on the Pixel 7a, utilizing a 64MP primary sensor that has yet to appear anywhere else in the lineup. Don't let that megapixel count fool you — despite being the highest resolution we've seen on a Pixel to date, it's still a smaller sensor than what's found on the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. There's a reason Google managed to slim the camera bar down on this phone, and it all comes down to the sheer size of the hardware.

That said, Google's camera performance relies pretty heavily on post-processing, using industry-best computational photography to produce those images we've come to love from Pixel. And with the 7a following in the footsteps of most modern smartphones — binning its 64MP shots down to 16MP — it should come as no surprise that the results are mighty familiar.

At the risk of sounding reductive, those sure look like Pixel photos. While I'm sure some pixel peeping (heh) could lead me to determine that the Pixel 7's main sensor can produce better shots of the exact same subject, I'm pretty happy with what I'm seeing from the Pixel 7a. Google's processing continues to make mediocre photographers like me look like we know what we're doing (we don't), which is all I ask for from my smartphone. Colors are punchy without, to my eyes, looking overly saturated, and both overcast and sunny scenes are captured with the same level of accuracy.

Likewise, night shots left me satisfied, especially coming off recent reviews with particularly bad low-light performance. The sky's a little bluer than it was when many of these shots were actually taken (just after dusk), but whether it's the soft glow of a lantern ornament or the bright neon of a store sign, I'm pretty happy with how these shots turned out.

The ultrawide lens on the Pixel 7a is, in an interesting twist, actually wider than what you'll find on the Pixel 7 by six degrees. In taking photos with both phones back-to-back, it's a noticeable difference, and it continues to draw attention to a sensor on Google's 2022 smartphone that, frankly, might not deserve the word "ultrawide" in comparison with other phones on the market today. That said, photos of the same subject tended to look a bit darker when shooting ultrawide, so you'll want to be careful when and where you employ it — even cloudy days made for a major difference.

A lesson in not zooming in too far.

Overall, this is the most boring photos have ever been on a Pixel phone, and frankly, that's a good thing. Even when utilizing new hardware, it's tough to tell which Pixel 7 device these photos were taken on — as long as you keep your zooming to a minimum. While 2x digital zoom looks fine, details disappear pretty quickly once you crop in any farther.

In my earliest impressions of the phone's video quality, I found 1080p recordings not too shabby, and I was really impressed by the phone's ability to adjust for my shaky hands, even as I zoomed in on a subject. Image and video stabilization shined on the Pixel 7 series last year, and I'm happy to see a similar performance here. Also, Google now supports 4K recording on all rear and front cameras, though the latter is limited to 30FPS.

My thoughts on the Pixel 7a's battery life can, truthfully, be split up into two sections: before and after a complete factory reset following the phone's official announcement at Google I/O. In the run-up to our initial publication of this review, my battery life was absolutely terrible, delivering some of the worst performance I've seen on Android in this decade. I'm talking three to four hours of screen-on time with light-to-moderate use of Wi-Fi on its best days. Just take a look at these numbers:

A bunch of battery charts from throughout my first week with the phone.

Let's focus on my experience first, and then I'll rope in the experiences of other editors at AP. While I think the battery charts shared above really speak for themselves, allow me to expand on how my time with the Pixel 7a was spent.

So, a couple of caveats. First up: yes, I spent the vast majority of my time at 90Hz. I already described how the phone ships with Smooth Display disabled because of Google's battery concerns, but frankly, dropping down to 60Hz didn't help me survive past 8pm on a Saturday. While I'm sure some people manage their entire digital lives on their smartphone, mine is primarily meant for wasting time on (insert social network here), music and podcasts, and messaging. This is how I've used every phone I've reviewed during my tenure at Android Police, and it's how I reviewed this one.

Second: I did choose to transfer apps and account data from an older phone; in this case, my Pixel 7. Before you drop down to the comments to berate me for my decision, hear me out. Google's setup process puts a large emphasis on moving data over from an older phone, either via a tethered cable or through a cloud backup. If you're following along with the on-screen steps, the ability to skip this transfer isn't made apparent until several taps after Google tells you to connect your two devices together.

To me, it's clear that moving data between devices is considered an essential part of buying a new smartphone. While I know plenty of enthusiasts — including, occasionally, myself — prefer to set up a new device app by app, account by account, that's not what the typical buyer wants to do. Even if this is the cause behind my battery drain, that doesn't excuse the numbers I'm seeing.

Now, all of that said, other editors at AP — especially those who didn't active 90Hz mode and performed a clean setup without data transfer — saw radically different numbers than I did. So, after the initial review period, I factory reset my phone, bypassing Google's usual restoration process and installing apps straight from the Play Store. And, as expected, my experience changed pretty drastically. Granted, you're not going to squeeze two days of heavy use out of the Pixel 7a, but reaching five hours of screen-on time with low-to-moderate use? Totally doable. Here are some additional numbers:

Keep in mind, this is with 90Hz and AOD enabled; the only thing I changed was performing a factory reset. I tried to ensure I installed the same apps from the Play Store as well, just to keep things equal.

Here's my main takeaway here: if you're getting this phone, and you can afford the time and patience, consider performing a clean install, without transferring data and accounts from your old phone. It definitely made a difference here, and not just on battery life — the entire device felt faster and smoother, as I touched on in the performance section above.

But none of this means I'm giving Google a break on my initial experience. The company pushes its new wireless transfer process in its Pixel 7a ad campaigns, but if it's enough to drastically reduce battery life and performance after setup, that's a real issue that buyers need to know about.

And, regardless of all of this, it's important to stress that five hours of screen-on time still isn't particularly impressive. When Snapdragon 8 Gen 2-powered devices — as expensive as they may be — are coming close to doubling those numbers, it's a sign that Google needs to figure out how to optimize its Tensor chipsets.

Do you know what really rubbed salt in my battery life-based wounds? Google's insistence on slow charging speeds. Granted, I wouldn't expect to see the company push the envelope here when the Pixel 7 Pro can't even reach 30W, but regardless, it's absolutely infuriating. If you're trying to top your phone up during dinner before heading out for a late night concert — and in my experience, you'll want to — expect to wait a while. Powering up from 50% to full took me over an hour.

For the first time ever, wireless charging is on an A-series device. Frankly, I'm not much of a believer in wireless charging outside of MagSafe — I just pick my phone up too much throughout the day, and at night, I'd rather plug my device in. While it's good to know you can power up on those scattered pucks and docks throughout your house, once again, keep time in mind.

Google confirmed to me that the Pixel 7a supports 5W with Qi-certified BPP chargers, which will take hours to fill from a dead battery. Again, I'm happy to see it here — companies like OnePlus will sell you a more expensive device without wireless charging — but if you're in the market for something speedy, you'll need to look elsewhere.

More than ever, the field is stacked against the Pixel 7a. Google's sub-$500 smartphone once reigned supreme as the obvious choice for an affordable, capable Android device, but in 2023, the competition — including Google itself — has caught up. So, if you're looking to spend around $500, what can your money get you?

Let's start with Google's most direct competition: the Samsung Galaxy A54. The latest entry in Samsung's massively-popular A-series is a relatively minor upgrade when compared to its previous generation, but for $450 — or less, if you can find it on sale or plan on buying through a carrier — it provides a solid alternative to the Pixel 7a. Its design closely aligns with the Galaxy S23 series, providing a flagship-style look for a midrange device, and much of its specs sheet (charging speeds, battery capacity, refresh rate, and even update support) manages to best Google.

That said, if you prefer the Pixel approach to software over Samsung's, an additional OS upgrade won't do you much good. Likewise, the photos captured by the Pixel 7a are leaps and bounds better than what we've seen from the A-series. It's a good alternative, but there isn't necessarily a clear winner between the two — rather, you'll need to consider what you personally want from a smartphone.

If you're dead set on buying a smartphone from Google, the Pixel 7 might actually be the better buy this year. I've already mentioned their design comparisons, but it's worth highlighting just what an extra hundred dollars gets you. A bigger display with better panel quality, a larger sensor capable of collecting more light, and — at least in my experience — more consistent battery life.

I can't even use the Pixel 7's age against the 7a when comparing the two together. Despite being seven months older, the Pixel 7 will see the same OS upgrades as the Pixel 7a, which leaves me scratching my head as to why most people should pick up the Pixel 7a when these prices are so similar. Perhaps carrier deals will manage to provide an answer.

Should you buy it?

The Pixel 7a earns my recommendation, but not without some massive caveats that weren't present in previous A-series devices. Google might impress me with its camera results and its software experience, but none of that matters if a phone can't survive to bedtime. I didn't enjoy revisiting the battery anxiety that plagued smartphones of the 2010s, and I wouldn't want anyone else to experience that feeling, either.

Resetting my device seemed to help, and in that case, I'm pleading with anyone buying this phone to go through with a clean install, no matter how much additional time it takes. I don't think this is a solution so much as a bandage, and I'll be closely watching the battery performance of future Pixel devices, including this summer's Pixel Fold.

Even putting aside my battery life problems, its frequent overheating, dated design, and the increased price all work against Google's latest smartphone, leaving me feeling pretty chilly towards a Pixel for the first time in years. With the company's lineup more expansive than ever, I'm just not sure what the A-series is doing to stand out anymore. That jaw-dropping price from previous generations might reappear in various sales over the next few months, but it's not here at launch. Without it, I'm left wondering if this device amounts to much more than a slightly worse Pixel 7 for slightly less money. But hey, that might be what the market wants.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a vs. Pixel 6a: All the differences
Publisher: Tom's Guide
Author: Philip Michaels

Text: A Google Pixel 7a vs. Pixel 6a comparison shows off all the changes Google made to its budget phone this year — and there are a lot of changes to talk about. The latest version of Google's midrange phone has more in common with the Pixel 7 than it does with its predecessor, as Google hopes to still offer one of the best cheap phones around amid growing competition.

To that end, the Pixel 7a introduces a new fast-refreshing display, wireless charging support and an upgraded rear camera array. The biggest change, though, could be adding the Tensor G2 chipset, which introduces the same AI-powered features you'll find on board the Pixel 7. Our Pixel 7a review details the full impact of these improvements on Google's midrange phone.

The Pixel 7a may be the successor to the Pixel 6a, but it doesn't replace the phone entirely. Google has kept the Pixel 6a around, but lowered the price. Opt for the Pixel 6a and you're getting a phone with the same chipset found in the Pixel 6  but at a much lower price than before.

The Pixel 7a will be looking to top that while also fending off stepped up competition from the likes of the Samsung Galaxy A54. (For a look at how that confrontation is shaping up, checking out our Samsung Galaxy A54 vs. Google Pixel 7a comparison.) Here's what's changed for Google's phones, as detailed by our Pixel 7a vs. Pixel 6a face-off.

The Pixel 6a debuted at $449, but it's now a $349 phone after Google dropped the price by $100 to mark the launch of the Pixel 7a. It's possible the best Pixel 6a deals can lower the price further, as we had seen some retailers offering the 6a for less than $300. (That was just before the Pixel 7a launch, so it could be a case of retailers trying to clear out inventory.)

The Pixel 7a costs $499, which reflects a $50 price hike from the 6a's debut price a year ago, though as we'll see below, there are plenty of new features to justify that higher price. And while the Pixel 7a is a more expensive phone than its predecessor, it still gives you a top midrange phone for less than $500.

Still, the biggest challenge for the Pixel 7a is the price of rival phones. Besides the reduced price of the Pixel 6a, there's the Samsung Galaxy A54, which costs $50 less than the Pixel 7a. And the iPhone SE 2022 is available for $429.

Both the Pixel 6a and Pixel 7a ship with 128GB of storage with no microSD slot or expanding capacity. The Pixel 7a offers more RAM — 8GB to the Pixel 6a's 6GB.

The Pixel 7a essentially mirrors the Pixel 6a's appearance, with a horizontal camera bar stretching across the back of the phone housing two rear cameras. In contrast to Google's flagships, the A Series phones tend to have slightly thicker bezels around the display, and that's the case here.

Because the Pixel 7a more closely resembles the Pixel 7, the camera bar a little more polished, but apart from an aluminum frame, the 7a uses plastic  for its back. The Pixel 7a and Pixel 6a measure an identical 6 x 2.8 x 0.4 inches, though the newer phone weights half-an ounce more.

You'll get one additional color option with the Pixel 7a, which features a Coral color that's exclusive to Google's store. Otherwise, your Pixel 7a color choices are Snow, Charcoal and Sea (a light blue) compared to Charcoal, Chalk and Sage for the Pixel 6a.

The Pixel 7a features the same screen size as its predecessor — a 6.1-inch OLED panel housed with 2400 x 1080 resolution. However, the Pixel 7a enjoys a big advantage over the Pixel 6a in the form of a faster refresh rate for its display.

The Pixel 6a is locked at a 60Hz rate no matter what's happening on the screen. However, you can change a Pixel 7a setting to let it ramp up its refresh rate to 90Hz for times when you'll benefit from smoother scrolling and more immersive graphics. When activated, the refresh rate on the Pixel 7a display automatically scales between 60Hz and 90Hz.

The Pixel 7a's display is brighter than what you get with the Pixel 6a — 931 nits compared to 778 nits. The two phones capture similar amounts of the sRGB color gamut — about 111% in Natural mode — though we found the colors to be a bit more accurate on the Pixel 7a panel.

One of the biggest Pixel 7a vs. Pixel 6a differences involves the rear camera setup. While the Pixel 6a managed to produce some pretty impressive pictures with a 12.2MP main lens and a 12MP ultrawide shooter, the Pixel 7a enjoys more megapixels.

Specifically, the Pixel 7a offers a 64MP main camera with a larger sensor than what you get from the Pixel 6a. The result is that the Pixel 7a can let in more light, which should enhance the details of its photos. The ultrawide camera gets a boost to a 13MP sensor.

Up front, the selfie cam is now a 13MP shooter on the Pixel 7a, compared to the Pixel 7a's 8MP front camera.

We haven't compared photos from the Pixel 7a to what the Pixel 6a has captured yet — our focus has been on comparisons to the Galaxy A54 camera setup. But our assumption is that Pixel 7a photos will look a lot more detailed than what the Pixel 6a was able to produce — and we considered the Pixel 6a to be one of the best camera phones. We do know that the Super Res Zoom feature on the Pixel 7a now supports an 8x zoom, compared to 7x for the Pixel 6a.

It's a tale of two Tensors for the Pixel 7a and Pixel 6a. The new phone gets the Tensor G2 found in the Pixel 7 lineup, while the Pixel 6a runs on an older Tensor G1.

Performance isn't the key driver behind Tensor — Google's chip is more about the AI-driven experiences the chipset enables. And indeed, benchmarks are pretty identical between the Pixel A series phones, even with the Pixel 7a's extra RAM.

The Pixel 7a improves upon the Pixel 6a's multicore score in Geekbench 5, though the older phone has the better single-core results. The two phones both produced about 41 frames per second in 3DMark's Wild Life Unlimited graphics benchmark.

The test that has us scratching our heads is our Adobe Premiere Rush test in which we transcode a video and time the results. The Pixel 7a took 7 seconds longer than the 6a to complete the task despite its newer processor. While these numbers aren't very encouraging from a Pixel 7 standpoint, if you decide that the cheaper Pixel 6a is right for you, at least you know you're not sacrificing much in the way of performance gains.

Battery life hasn't been a strong point for recent Pixel phones, but at least the Pixel 7a takes a modest step toward righting the course. Despite a slightly smaller battery than the Pixel 6a — 4,385 mAh versus 4,410 mAh — the Pixel 7a lasted longer on our battery test, in which we have phones surf the web until they run out power.

The Pixel 7a lasted 10 hours and 5 minutes on our battery test, handily beating out the Pixel 6a's disappointing 6 hour and 29 minute time. Even better, the Pixel 7a's result beats the average smartphone time on our test, if only be about 10 minutes or so.

There is a caveat to the Pixel 7a's result — we recorded that with the faster refresh rate disabled. We're still running tests to see how the Pixel 7a performs when its screen can ramp up to 90Hz, but generally that feature tends to put a hit on battery life. Even so, we'd expect its time to still be better than the Pixel 6a.

There's no change to the 18W wired charging speed both Pixel A series phone supports, but the Pixel 7a does enjoy one advantage over the 6a. Google's new phone now supports wireless charging, just like Google's pricier flagship phones do.

Both phones are currently running Android 13 and will be able to upgrade to Android 14 in the fall. That'll be the second of three promised OS updates for the Pixel 6a, though, since the phone debuted with Android 12. That means Android 15 in 2024 should be the last supported update for the Pixel 6a. The Pixel 7a, in contrast, can count on updates through 2025.

The big story here is what the Tensor G2 chip inside the Pixel 7a enables. Features like Photo Unblur, speaker labels in the Recorder app and more advanced call management tools that debuted with the Pixel 7 are all available to the Pixel 7a.

A Pixel 7a vs. Pixel 6a comparison isn't merely about detailing the differences. Since you can still buy a discounted Pixel 6a, knowing how the phones compare can help you decide whether to get the $499 Pixel 7a or the $349 Pixel 6a.

It's clear that the Pixel 7a is the more fully featured phone. With its faster refresh rate, improved cameras and Tensor G2 chip, the Pixel 7a is a more capable phone — pretty much the equal to the Pixel 7. The Pixel 6a is still a formidable budget phone in its own right, but it can't match the Pixel 7a's capabilities. This new phone is a big leap forward for Google's midrange models.

As all good things come to an end, so does the Pixel 6a has to throw in the towel and welcome its successor, the newly-announced Google Pixel 7a. With a refreshed design, improved camera, and improved internals, the Pixel 7a is a decent follow-up to the Pixel 6a, but definitely not much better in any way. At $499, the Pixel 7a is a slightly tougher morsel to swallow, especially if you consider the fact that immediately after its announcement, the Pixel 6a dropped down to $349, which is a killer price for a still perfectly capable phone!What are the intricate differences between the Pixel 7a and the Pixel 6a, and is there anything remotely intriguing to warrant an upgrade from last year's superb affordable Pixel phone? Should you upgrade? If you're currently using a Pixel 6a and have not experienced any of the horror stories that usually befall Pixel phones, then I wouldn't say you have a very big incentive to get the Pixel 7a. Sure, it has some fresh nice-to-haves, but overall, the Pixel 6a will deliver the same overall experience.

Being a direct successor to the Pixel 6a but also drawing lots of inspiration from the new Pixel 7 family as well, the Pixel 7a is a phone that carries that unmistakable Pixel DNA in itself. Little has changed, and at the same time, the Pixel 7a is quite different from the Pixel 6a. Hate it or love it, the black camera strip at the back of the Pixel 6a goes down in history and makes way for the Pixel 7a's emphasized metal camera bar. I personally loved how unique the so-called 3D Metal Visor. This one seamlessly blends with the anodized aluminum side frame of the phone and ensures a bolder and more pronounced new look.

See the full Google Pixel 7a vs Google Pixel 6a size comparison or compare them to other phones using our Size Comparison tool.

From a design perspective, it probably wouldn't be very surprising to see that the Pixel 7a and the Pixel 6a are mostly similar when observed from the front. Both devices have similarly-sized 6.1-inch OLED screens, relatively thick bezels that you will eventually get used to, and the good ol' punch-hole camera cutout. No headphone jacks, no microSD card expansion slots, and the usual button placement on all sides. The fingerprint scanner is, once again, embedded within the display, but we have Face Unlock on the Pixel 7a.

And yes, the Pixel 7a feels slightly heavier than the Pixel 6a, but not overbearingly so. Speaking of the screen, while there are seemingly lots of similarities (6.1-inch size, OLED technology, FHD+ resolution), an important new feature of the Pixel 7a makes it a much more intriguing device. With a 90Hz screen refresh rate, the new device will provide much smoother interface navigation, a step up from the traditional 60Hz screen that the Pixel 6a carries. This is an important feature, definitely one of the more impressive nice-to-haves in the sub-$500 category.

In real life, you will find some minor differences between the two phones. The Pixel 7a has a marginally higher maximum brightness and refresh rate (if you enable it), but otherwise, colors, contrast, and viewing angles are similar on both. Having debuted on the Pixel 7 series in late 2022, the Tensor G2 chipset powers the new Pixel 7a, with all of its artificial intelligence and machine-learning chops on deck. Yes, the same processor that's responsible for doing the heavy-lifting inside Google's latest flagships is on the Pixel 7a, which is a major, major selling point of the new device. Meanwhile, the Pixel 6a comes with the Tensor G1 chipset, which actually isn't that far off from its successor. What are the main differences between the two chips? Few in-between, actually. Both the Tensor G1 and G2 come with a 2+2+4 chipset configuration, consisting of two high-performance ARM Cortex-X1 cores and four Cortex-A55 ones. Yet, the Tensor G1 uses the Cortex-A76 mid-range cores, while the Tensor G2 has the slightly faster Cortex-A78 cores. This is why the raw performance difference between the two chips isn't that big, so no, the Tensor G2 isn't much faster than its predecessor.

In real life, don't expect to notice a substantial difference either. Both phones are perfectly capable of running through your daily schedule with gusto, capably juggling between apps and activities. The only slight issue you might notice is in gaming: while neither phone will overheat during gaming, expect some frame drops during prolonged gaming sessions, as well as a big hit on your battery life. Another difference between the Pixel 7a and the Pixel 6a is the amount of RAM on board - 8GB vs 6GB. That's a big leap in available memory which can potentially improve the multitasking prowess of the new device and make it way more future-proof.  Both devices utilize dual-camera layouts at the back, pairing wide and ultra-wide lenses, but that's where most similarities end.

While the Pixel 6a relies on one of Google's favorite camera sensors which was used on many Pixel phones throughout the years, the Sony IMX363, the Pixel 7a will adopt a brand new sensor. A 64MP 1/1.7-inch Sony IMX787-powered camera will be carrying the torch for the Pixel 7a, a rather stark improvement over the 12.2MP 1/2.55-inch Sony IMX363 wide camera on the Pixel 6a.

While the resolution alone is a big enhancement of its own, the much larger new sensor could potentially vastly improve the low-light capabilities of the Pixel 7a. Considering Google's heavy reliance on advanced image-processing algorithms and artificial intelligence, we'd expect the Pixel 7a to punch way above its weight and rival way more expensive devices in the camera department. In broad daylight, you can expect mostly similar image quality from both phones. The Pixel 7a has that edge when it comes to detail, which can most certainly be traced back to the new sensor used. Colors also seem slightly less warm on the Pixel 7a, making them truer to real life. And, if your subject would stay still for just a minute, you can reap great results with either phone. Colors are lively––and lovely––on both phones, but I'd have to generally lean for the Pixel 7a, which delivers tones that are truer to real life. The signature dramatic Pixel look with its often gritty contrast and flatter dynamics is present on both the Pixel 7a and the Pixel 6a. The 2X zoom mode on both phones is as far as I'd usually zoom, as the image quality quickly falls off once you get past 2X. The Pixel 6a has noticeably more over-sharpening, which gives it that "smartphone" look which isn't great. As far as I'm concerned, there's no excessive over-sharpening on the Pixel 7a, which delivers detail that looks way more natural in comparison.  The ultra-wide camera on the Pixel 7a is new, too. Unlike the Pixel 6a, which comes with a 12MP Sony IMX386-powered one, the Pixel 7a relies on a 13MP Sony IMX712 sensor for its ultra-wide shenanigans, which could also improve its imaging capabilities in this camera feature. Most importantly, however, is the vastly expanded field of view on the Pixel 7a, which allows you to fit way more content in your photo. Fitting that much would require you to take a step back with the Pixel 6a, and doing that is not always possible: imagine you're trekking a mountainous backcountry. Selfies are similar on both the Pixel 7a and the Pixel 6a, with the most notable difference being this reviewer's inability to take two identical photos. In my defense, my glasses lost the battle against the bright May sun.  In terms of audio quality and haptics, the Pixel 7a sounds slightly more powerful than its predecessor, with a slightly wider soundstage and more pronounced mids. Base isn't particularly rich or deep, but overall, sound is quite enjoyable. You might not notice such a big difference in comparison with the Pixel 6a.Haptics-wise, both phones provide a decent experience, with vibrations that feel largely okay, neither too tack-sharp nor too muddy. The Pixel 7a comes with a 4,385mAh battery, a slight downgrade from the 4,410mAh one on the Pixel 6a. However, it's doubtful that you will notice a major difference due to the smaller battery cell. In the PhoneArena custom web browsing battery test, which simulates a garden-variety web browsing with the screen set at 200 nits, the Pixel 7a lasts a few extra hours over the Pixel 6a. Technically, you could say that the difference in our web browsing test puts the Pixel 7a in the winning spot, but the margin is very thin. Finally, the biggest difference between the two devices can be seen in our gaming battery benchmark, which simulates a 3D gaming experience. In this exercise, the Pixel 6a lasts considerably more, but its screen only refreshes at up to 60Hz, so the Pixel 7a's noticeably 'weaker' result stems to the fact that it has a higher refresh rate and incapable of achieving a higher FPS count.

When it comes to charging, we already established that the Pixel 7a will be scoring wireless charging, a first for an affordable Pixel phone, but sadly, don't expect too fast of a charging solution. Google has thrown in 7.5W wireless charging, which is essentially way below the 15W wireless charging standard that most flagships boast. Aside from that, there's 18W wired charging on the new Pixel 7a, just as fast as its predecessor, so it should top up the phone in roughly an hour and a half.

And, just like with the Pixel 6a, don't expect to see a charger inside the Pixel 7a box. You will either have to buy straight from Google if you don't have a suitable charger, or rely on a third-party solution that might charge the phone slower.

So, what are the hardware Pixel 7a v Pixel 6a specs differences? Check these out in our dedicated table below:So, is the Pixel 7a a better phone than its predecessor? Certainly. It improves some key aspects of the overall experience, but doesn't really break new ground. I guess we could say that incremental revolutionary steps is what Google has taken with its latest Pixel phone. Does this mean you should upgrade from the Pixel 6a? No, not at all. The latter is still perfectly capable of holding its ground against the Pixel 7a. Sure, you get slightly upgraded hardware with the new phone, but aside from the 90Hz display, the rest of the changes don't overhaul the experience.The Pixel 6a price drop to $349 following the announcement of the $499 Pixel 7a don't help the latter's case either. If you wish to squeeze out the best value out of a Pixel phone, it's hard to pass up the Pixel 6a. However, if you're coming from an older Pixel and plan on using your device for a long time, future-proofing yourself with the Pixel 7a makes sense.

Softtitle: Looking for 5G phones under Rs 40,000? Pixel 7a and more available at discounted prices in India
Publisher: India Today
Author: Ankita Garg

Text: By Ankita Garg: Are you looking for 5G phones under Rs 40,000 in India? Well, there are no sale events going on at Amazon or Flipkart, but you can still buy the Pixel 7a and other phones at discounted prices. The OnePlus 11R and iQOO Neo 7 are also available at lower prices, but only if you have select bank cards. People can also opt for exchange offers to get more discounts on such 5G phones. Here are all the details.

The Pixel 7a was recently launched in India and the latest mid-range 5G phone is available at a discounted price with a bank card offer. The Pixel 7a can be purchased at an effective price of Rs 39,999 via Flipkart if you have HDFC bank cards. The original price of the phone is Rs 43,999, which means that you are getting a discount of Rs 4,000 on the Pixel 7a if you have this bank card.

Pixel 7a: Is it worth buying in India?

It is a good phone for those who want a vibrant display, a great camera, a premium design, and overall good performance at a reasonable price. This one even has support for wireless charging tech and IP67 water-resistant rating. It offers Google’s flagship Tensor G2 SoC, 18W wired charging support, and a 4,300mAh battery. Do keep in mind that you don’t get a charger in the retail box. People can either choose to use an old charger or buy a new one. You also get a clean, simplified, and fast user interface, which is something that many Android phones fail to offer.

Note: The discount offer on the bank card is available for a limited time period and so one will have to pay Rs 4,000 more, which you don’t have to pay now if you have a HDFC bank card. It is currently unknown when this offer will expire.

The OnePlus 11R is listed on Flipkart at a discounted price of Rs 39,722 and there is also a 1,250 discount on HDFC bank credit card EMI transactions. This bank offer brings down the price to Rs 38,472.

OnePlus 11R: Is it worth buying in India?

People who want a slightly better performance and faster charging support with a bigger battery can consider buying the OnePlus 11R instead of Pixel 7a. It comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset, 100W fast charging support, and a 5,000mAh battery. But, the camera is of course not as good as Pixel 7a. It is worth highlighting that OnePlus also bundles a charger in the box, so one here doesn’t have to spend extra for this.

The iQOO Neo 7 is listed on Amazon at its original price of Rs 29,999, but there are discount offers available on HDFC and ICICI bank cards. Consumers will get Rs 2,000 off if they make payments using the mentioned bank cards. This effectively brings down the price to Rs 27,999.

iQOO Neo 7: Is it worth buying in India?

If your budget is on the lower side and need a 5G phone with good performance, the iQOO Neo 7 is the phone you should buy. It is using a MediaTek Dimensity 8200 SoC, which is capable of offering a smooth performance to consumers as long as you don’t put a very heavy load on it. The company bundles 120W fast charger, which can quickly charge the phone’s 5,000mAh battery. The 120Hz HDR 10+ display is pretty good for binge-watching. Of course, the camera performance is not as good as Pixel 7a.

Those who want bigger discounts should wait for e-commerce platforms like Flipkart and Amazon to host sale events. The companies recently wrapped up their Summer sale events. People can choose to wait for a few more weeks for better discounts, considering the e-commerce sites keep running sales in every month or so.

Softtitle: The $500 Google Pixel 7a is one of the best budget phones ever
Publisher: CNN Underscored
Author: Max Buondonno
Date: 2023-05-10T18:50:26.667Z
Text: A device with a 90Hz display, the same performance as a flagship Pixel 7, a triple-camera system and a glass design for under $500? That almost seems too good to be true.

But lo and behold, that’s exactly what we got. The Pixel 7a, a successor to last year’s excellent Pixel 6a, focuses on acing the fundamentals of a great smartphone, all while letting the core Pixel experience shine through. This phone may be priced at $499, but it certainly doesn’t feel like it. It also puts the regular Pixel 7 in an awkward position given how similar the two devices are.

With the exception of a couple minor caveats, the Pixel 7a is an incredible smartphone for the money. Here’s what I learned about it during my 10 days of testing.

The Pixel 6a impressed me last year with its high-end design, and the 7a follows suit. It takes after the flagship Pixel 7 series with a glass and aluminum exterior accented by a large camera bump. It’s essentially a smaller Pixel 7, making it one of the nicest-looking midrange smartphones on the market. I’d bet you could trick anyone into thinking this was an $800-plus smartphone from the design alone.

Google also nailed the size. Like I said, this is basically a smaller Pixel 7, swapping out that device’s 6.4-inch display for one that measures 6.1 inches. That doesn’t seem like a huge difference, but it makes the 7a even easier to hold and use in one hand. And while it’s heavier than the 6a was at 6.8 ounces versus 6.3 ounces, it’s still lightweight and comfortable to hold for long periods of time.

There are a few color options available: Charcoal, Snow, Coral and Sea. I got Sea, and I can confirm that it’s a very nice blue. It’s pretty subtle — a lot of the photos I took of the phone made it look white — but it’s a very nice finish nonetheless. If you want your phone to pop, you’ll want to grab the Coral model.

Around the device, you’ll find the usual array of volume and power buttons, a USB-C cable, a SIM card tray and stereo speakers. The phone is rated at IP67 for water and dust resistance, so you won’t have to worry about getting it wet. In addition, Google is selling $29 cases for the 7a with silicone finishes, and they’re very nice. My case matches the Sea colorway of the 7a, which helps to accentuate the finish.

The Pixel 7a’s 6.1-inch screen is the same size as the 6a, with the same Full HD+ resolution and OLED panel to boot. What’s different this year is the inclusion of a faster refresh rate.

The 6a came with a 60Hz refresh rate, which means any content on the display updates 60 times per second. That’s been the standard since the inception of all-touchscreen smartphones, but things have changed over the past few years as more and more phones adopt faster refresh rates like 90Hz and 120Hz, making everyday interactions with your phone feel smoother and faster.

As for the Pixel 7a, Google is giving it an upgrade to 90Hz, which is a big deal. Not only does it make the 7a the first Pixel A-series device to get one, but it also moves the device closer to flagship status. For context, it’s the same refresh rate as the Pixel 7, which makes using the 7a feel just like you’re using the regular 7. Everything from scrolling Twitter to animations is silky smooth, and the entire software experience feels more responsive as a result.

Unlike the Pixel 7, the 7a doesn’t ship with 90Hz turned on out of the box. You have to go into display settings to turn it on (just look for “Smooth display” and flick the toggle). I asked Google why it wasn’t turned on by default and the company said it’s to maximize battery life. I’ll get to battery life later, but it’s worth mentioning that I didn’t notice a huge drop in endurance with 90Hz enabled.

I encourage everyone to flick it on the second they take their 7a out of the box. It’s one of those features that’s truly life-changing; if you’ve never used a smartphone with a faster refresh rate than 60Hz, the 7a will convince you never to go back.

Beyond that, the actual quality of the Pixel 7a’s display is nice. I enjoyed watching many movie trailers and “South Park” episodes, thanks to its vibrant colors, good contrast and wide viewing angles. It’s an OLED panel, so you also get true-to-life black levels that you simply can’t replicate with LCD. It reaches 500 nits using the brightness slider and can max out at 1,000 nits in direct sunlight, which is about as much as you could ask for from a $500 phone. In addition, the 2400 x 1080 resolution is sharp enough that nothing looks blurry, including tiny text.

Following in the flagship trends of the Pixel 7a, Google decided to throw its Tensor G2 processor in this phone, which gives it nearly identical performance to the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro. It can easily beat the performance you’d get from a typical sub-$500 Android phone, all thanks to Google’s incredible optimizations. This phone is a screamer for the price.

Compared to the Pixel 7, the 7a is a tad slower. Google assured me that it’s using the same Tensor G2 as that device, but using the two devices side by side, I noticed that apps didn’t open with the same responsiveness, graphics-heavy games would drop frames more frequently and Google’s processing magic after tapping the shutter button in the camera app took a bit longer. I ran Geekbench 5 on the Pixel 7a and compared it to the scores I got from the regular 7, and the 7a fell a little bit short.

It also fell far behind the iPhone SE (2022) from Apple, whose A-series processors continue to outpace Google’s own chip line. You’ll also get better scores out of the Galaxy S23 with its Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip.

However, none of that is to say the Pixel 7a is a bad performer. In fact, it’s one of the best you’ll find on the entire smartphone market. Typical sub-$500 phones that come with a Snapdragon 400 or 600 series processor can’t hold a candle to what the Tensor G2 is capable of, so if good performance is on your wish list from a new smartphone, the 7a won’t let you down.

The chip is paired with 8GB of RAM, which is plenty to keep apps from crashing or reloading frequently, and there’s 128GB of storage for storing all the content you need.

I was honestly baffled every time I took a photo using the Pixel 7a. Not because the camera app was confusing or I couldn’t find where the pictures were stored, but because of how good each one came out.

Google includes a new 64-megapixel main camera on the back of the 7a, which is a massive upgrade over the aging 12.2-megapixel sensor from the 6a. It’s technically a less capable camera than the 50-megapixel shooter on the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro, but it has more resolution for Google’s processing algorithms to play with. And let me tell you, it kicks out some impressive results.

I spent most of my time comparing photos taken on the 7a to the regular Pixel 7, just to see how similar they are. To my surprise, they’re more similar than you could ever imagine. Here’s a quick side-by-side comparison — I’d bet you wouldn’t be able to tell which photo was taken on the 7a and which was taken on the 7 if I didn’t label them.

That’s been the case with every photo I’ve taken with the 7a. Each offers excellent color reproduction, Google’s signature contrasty aesthetic, excellent white balance and good detail — even in low light. In fact, I’ll go as far to say that if you want to take pictures at night and you’re on a budget, this should be the only phone you consider; Google’s Night Sight and Astrophotography modes are just that good.

The main camera sits next to a 13-megapixel ultrawide with a 120-degree field of view. That’s wider than the 114-degree, 12-megapixel ultrawides on the Pixel 7 and 6a, allowing you to capture more of a scene in a single photo. It, too, comes with solid color reproduction and contrast, while highlights at times can get a bit overprocessed with Google’s HDR. It’s also a decent performer at night, but the main camera was able to capture a bit more light and detail overall.

There’s no telephoto sensor on the Pixel 7a, but Google does include a 2x zoom toggle if you want to punch in a bit without losing a ton of resolution. In addition, both rear cameras can shoot 4K video at 30 frames per second (fps) — 4K 60 fps is exclusive to the main lens — and footage is extremely solid for a $500 phone. While it won’t top the kings of smartphone videography — currently the iPhone 14 Pro and Galaxy S23 Ultra — it will provide some nice-looking clips for your next project or digital photo album.

In addition, there’s a 13-megapixel selfie shooter that’s sharp and wide enough to capture you and your friends in plenty of detail.

Google’s smart camera features like Night Sight, Magic Eraser (for removing unwanted objects and subjects using AI), Long Exposure, Photo Unblur and Real Tone (for representing skin color more accurately in processed photos) are on board the Pixel 7a, but there are some that are missing. Most notably, you won’t find Cinematic Blur or Action Pan, two features that remain exclusive to the higher-end Pixel 7 and 7 Pro. That simply means you can’t add a blurry background to your videos, which is a small sacrifice to make given this phone’s price point.

Overall, there wasn’t anything about the Pixel 7a’s cameras that I disliked. Not only will they beat out the quality of any other sub-$500 smartphone’s shooters, but they’re about on par with that of the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro, which says something about Google’s incredible post-processing magic.

During my review period, I never found it difficult to get through a full day on the Pixel 7a. Google includes a 4,385mAh battery (a tad smaller than the 4,410mAh cell in the 6a), and it provides just enough power to last a full 16-hour day before dropping to about 15 to 20%.

Mind you, this was with the 90Hz refresh rate enabled. If you turn it off, you’ll get even longer endurance. I ended days with 40 to 50% left in the tank under that condition, which means you could pull off two full days on a single charge if you’re careful.

If you run out of power, Google includes both wired and wireless charging, giving you more versatility to juice back up and get on with your day.

I say this a lot whenever I talk about a Pixel phone, but boy do I love the software experience. Google’s take on Android 13 is a simple delight to interact with, whether you’re sifting through your home screen pages, tweaking your device’s settings or managing notifications. From its springy animations to the abundantly welcoming Material You interface, the Pixel experience is simply unmatched in the world of Android. It’s a lot cleaner than something like Samsung’s One UI, which, at times, can feel overwhelming. And it’s far superior to anything OnePlus, TCL or Motorola is putting out.

It’s also incredibly smart. I adore having Call Screen so I can utilize the Google Assistant and ask who’s calling before answering, Direct My Call gives me a visual menu of pressable keys on phone trees when I call a business, At a Glance gives me a preview of my day right on my lock screen and voice typing with the Assistant helps jotting out long paragraphs a breeze. There’s also the handy Recorder app with live transcriptions and speaker labels, Clear Calling for higher-quality voice calls and Quick Phrases that let you give the Assistant simple commands to get things done (like saying, “Stop” when an alarm goes off or “Answer” when a call comes in, all without having to say, “Hey Google” first).

On the Pixel 7a, Android feels just as fast and fluid as it does on any other Pixel phone I’ve tested. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: This is my favorite incarnation of the Android experience. If you appreciate good software, you’ll love using the 7a.

The Pixel 7a also has great security. It’s driven by the Titan M2 chip, which encrypts the personal information on your phone and makes it less likely you’ll get hacked. There’s an optical fingerprint scanner under the display that’s fast and locks your device from prying eyes, and Google even throws in facial recognition for extra convenience.

In addition, Google includes access to a free VPN through Google One, even if you aren’t a paying subscriber. Just visit the Google One app and find the VPN section on the main page. From there, you can toggle it on or off whenever you want, allowing you to encrypt your web traffic whenever you’re on a public Wi-Fi network.

If you plug the Pixel 7a in to charge, you’ll max out at 18W of power. That used to be considered pretty fast, but in the current world of smartphones we live in, it’s particularly slow. More often than not, phones ship with 30 to 45W charging, which gives you that extra boost of power much quicker. From 0 to 100%, you’ll be waiting at least an hour and a half with the Pixel 7a, which is unfortunate.

On the wireless charging front, there’s 7.5W support here. It’s not all that common to find fast wireless charging on midrangers, but let’s not forget that Google once shipped a Pixel Stand that supported 23W charging. We know the company has the technology to make fast wireless charging possible — it just didn’t include it on the Pixel 7a.

In the United States, the Pixel 7a supports sub-6GHz 5G on every model. That’s good enough for most people, but for those who live near a mmWave tower (aka those in major cities who live on certain street corners), you’ll have to have service through Verizon.

That’s the only carrier supporting mmWave 5G on the 7a. What’s more, it’ll cost you an extra $50 to get a device with the band built in, totaling $549 for the whole package. Whether that’s worth it is up to you; for most people, it’s simply not because mmWave isn’t very widespread. Still, it’s an odd quirk.

I found it extremely difficult to find bad things about the Pixel 7a. For $499, this is one of the best smartphones I’ve ever used, let alone one of the best on the market today. The combination of a great display, great performance, stunning cameras, all-day battery life and a software experience unlike any other, Google has a true winner on its hands.

The Pixel 7a easily beats out other midrangers at similar price points like the Galaxy A54. It has better performance, cameras and software support than any other midrange phone.

Of course, it’s worth considering that the Pixel 7 can be had for the same $499 when it’s on sale, which is quite often. If you can find it for that price, you might want to skip the 7a and go for the proper flagship. You should also keep in mind that the Pixel 6a will continue to be sold for $299, which is a remarkable value in and of itself.

That being said, the moment the Pixel 7a gets discounted — and you know it will, if history is any indication — it’ll be a no-brainer. This phone under $400 would simply be impossible to compete with. It’s one of Google’s best phones to date, and it’s a force to be reckoned with.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a vs iPhone 14: the key differences

Text: Google finally unveiled its latest affordable smartphone – the Google Pixel 7a – at Google I/O 2023, with the device arriving to occupy the space between the already-released Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro (both of which launched in October 2022).

But despite the relative modesty of its price, the Pixel 7a still rivals some of 2023’s best phones in a handful of important areas. In this article, then, we assess how the phone stacks up against Apple’s latest vanilla flagship, the iPhone 14, when it comes to things like price, design, performance, cameras and battery life.

We've reviewed both devices – check out our Google Pixel 7a review here – but below, we whip through the key differences (and similarities) between the two popular handsets.

Here's how the two phones compare at a glance:

The Google Pixel 7a was unveiled at Google I/O 2023 and went on sale the very same day (May 10). It costs $499 / £449 / AU$749 for the single configuration option, which gives you 128GB of storage, with no option to expand that, and 8GB of RAM.

The iPhone 14 is the more expensive of the two phones. Apple’s latest vanilla flagship was officially unveiled on September 7, 2022, before going on sale on September 16 for the following prices:

At $499 / £449 / AU$749, then, the Google Pixel 7a is some $300 / £400 / AU$590 less than the iPhone 14.

On the design front, the iPhone 14 measures 146.7 x 71.5 x 7.8mm, weighs 172g and boasts a 6.1-inch, 60Hz Super XDR OLED display, which sports a 2532 x 1170 resolution.

The Google Pixel 7a, on the other hand, rocks a 6.1-inch, Full HD+ OLED screen with a 90Hz refresh rate, while the phone’s body measures 152.4 x 72.9 x 9mm (rising to 10.1mm at the camera bump).

In other words, the Google Pixel 7a is a touch larger than the iPhone 14, but its display – which looks set to be the same 6.1-inch size – offers a higher refresh rate (90Hz versus 60Hz), meaning slightly smoother visuals.

And, obviously, the Google Pixel 7a looks drastically different to the iPhone 14. Apple’s latest vanilla flagship maintains the straight-sided iPhone aesthetic first established by the iPhone 12, while the Pixel 7a inherits its predecessor’s design in all but its rear camera setup.

In many ways, then, the iPhone 14 and Pixel 7a suffer from similar cases of blandness, since neither phone reinvents their respective predecessors in any significant way. That's not a criticism, per se, but if you've been a fan of Google's phone designs over Apple's in recent years (or vice versa), neither the iPhone 14 nor the Pixel 7a is going to change your mind in that regard.

Other design differences between the two phones include their respective charging ports – the iPhone 14 rocks a Lightning port while the Pixel 7a uses USB-C – and they’re be available in different colors, too. The iPhone 14 is available in Midnight, Starlight, red, blue, purple and yellow shades, while the Pixel 7a ships in Charcoal, Snow, Sea and Coral (though the latter is only available from Google directly).

When it comes to cameras, the iPhone 14 sports a dual-sensor setup comprising a 12MP main lens (26mm, f/1.5) and a 12MP ultra-wide lens (13mm, f/2.4). On the front, you get a 12MP selfie snapper, which seems to be the standard for high-end smartphones in 2023.

The Pixel 7a, despite its smaller price tag, gets a whopping a 64MP main camera (26mm, f/1.9) with optical image stabilization, a 12MP ultra-wide snapper (f/2.2) and a 10.8MP selfie camera – meaning Google's latest mid-ranger actually trumps the iPhone 14 in the rear photography department.

That’s not to say that the iPhone 14 has poor main cameras by any means, though, and as you can see from the sample images below, you'll get consistently strong photos from both handsets. The Pixel 7a does, however, offer a touch more detail and slightly superior lighting.

It goes without saying, but Google’s latest phone also arranges its cameras in a slightly different way to the iPhone 14. While the iPhone 14 smushes its main and ultra-wide sensors into a neat corner square with the flash, the Pixel 7a follows its predecessor by organizing its rear snappers in a horizontal fashion.

On the performance front, the iPhone 14 uses the previous-generation version of Apple’s silicon – the A15 Bionic – which allows the device to meet the demands of streaming, swiping, snapping and gaming with ease.

Apple doesn't typically disclose the RAM specs of its iPhones, but eagle-eyed researchers have found that every model in the iPhone 14 line uses 6GB RAM.

The Pixel 7a packs Google’s Tensor G2 chipset, which is the same chipset as sported by the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. This processor doesn’t have the raw power to match Apple’s A15 Bionic or Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 and Gen 2 chips, but the Pixel 7a nonetheless offers real-world performance that’s largely comparable to devices that do use any one of those three processors (like the iPhone 14 or Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra). The Pixel 7a, then, should be plenty fast enough for most users.

Interestingly, the Pixel 7a actually boasts more RAM than the iPhone 14 – 8GB (LPDDR5) versus 6GB – so the device would technically offer a better multitasking experience if iOS and Android weren't built so differently. But iPhone 14 Pro Max also uses 6GB RAM and yet remains one of the best phones for multitasking, so make of that what you will.

Under the hood, the iPhone 14 sports a 3,279mAh battery that delivers a full day (and night) of use if the phone is used normally for everyday tasks.

You can buy a 5W adapter, or spend a bit more for Apple’s 20W charger, which will get you to 50% charge in 30 minutes. The phone is also MagSafe for iPhone and Qi wireless charging compatible.

The Google Pixel 7a, in contrast, packs a larger 4,385mAh battery but – and this is a real sticking point for the phone, in our opinion – this increased size doesn't yield better performance. In fact, the Pixel 7a's battery disappoints on multiple levels.

As TechRadar's US Mobiles Editor, Philip Berne, notes in his Google Pixel 7a review: "You should plan on leaving the Pixel 7a connected to a charger whenever you aren’t using it. This is not a phone you can rely on for long-term battery life. Google has an Extreme Battery Saver mode which it claims can last you up to three days of use, but it requires severely limiting which apps and features can be used – and I’d rather have a phone that lasts one normal day rather than three 'extreme' days."

In other words, the Pixel 7a isn't able to last a full day with moderate use, which makes the phone's battery the weak link in an otherwise excellent chain.

Text: A Google Pixel 7a vs. Pixel 7 comparison is just what we need now that, as of Google I/O 2023, both phones are on sale.

The Pixel 7a brings some big changes, such as a new $499 / AU$749 price point,  with a powerful new 64MP camera, a smoother 6.1-inch 90Hz display and wireless charging. Meanwhile, the Google Pixel 7 ($599 / AU$999) is powered by the same M2 chip that we're expecting to find in the Pixel 7a. But Google's current flagship features a larger 6.3-inch screen and a more premium design with Gorilla Glass on the front and back.

So what else is the same and what's different? That's what our Google Pixel 7a vs. Pixel 7 guide is for.

Starting at $599 / AU$999, the Pixel 7 is already pretty affordable relative to other flagships. Phones like the iPhone 14 and Galaxy S23 start at $799. The Pixel 7 undercuts those phones' prices by $200, making it something of a bargain.

Last year's Pixel 6a cost $449 but the Pixel 7a now goes for $499 / $749. That's still less than $500 in the US, but it narrows the gap between the Pixel 7a and the Pixel 7 to just $100.

You'll find it hard to see the differences between the Pixel 7 and the Pixel 7a. Both use Google's distinct metal camera bar on the back, and flat displays with a punch-hole selfie camera in the top center. The Pixel 7a is a little smaller at 6.1 inches, while the Pixel 7a measures a still compact (by today's smartphone standards) 6.3 inches.

Google's chosen materials differ a little too. The Pixel 7 has a Gorilla Glass Victus back panel, but the Pixel 7a uses thermoformed plastic. Both use aluminum sides and Gorilla Glass displays though.

Both displays on these phones use a 90Hz adaptive refresh rate. This is a first for a Pixel a-series model, and narrows the gap between the phones considerably.

Refresh rates on past Pixel A phones have been stuck at 60Hz, but a rumor suggests that's about to change with the Pixel 7a. A leaked prototype of the phone revealed a settings panel with a 90Hz refresh rate option. If that turns out to be true, it's one less difference between the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7a.

Color-wise, Google offers both phones in Snow (white), but there are different choices apart from that. The Pixel 7a comes in Charcoal (grey/black), Sea (pale blue) and Coral (orange), the latter being a Google Store exclusive. Your unique Pixel 7 choices are Obsidian (black) and Lemongrass (pale green).

When Google moved to a 50MP main camera with the Pixel 6 release, it created a noticeable split with A series phones, which continued to use a 12.2MP sensor — though has changed with the Pixel 7a's new 64MP sensor.

Along with a new 13MP ultrawide camera and 13MP main camera, the Pixel 7a beats the 50MP/12MP/10.8MP combination of the Pixel 7a when it comes to resolution. The cheaper Pixel has a size advantage too with its main sensor, important as this determines how much light a camera can capture.

We'll get back to you with a full camera comparison soon. There's a chance the Pixel 7 could still win overall, but we're leaning towards the Pixel 7a based on the specs.

The similarities continue under the hood. The Pixel 7 introduced the Tensor G2 silicon last fall, and now the same chip can be found in the Pixel 7a.

Since both phones also use 8GB RAM, this may have made you assume the two phones perform the same. But as you can see in the selected benchmarks below, there are some differences. While the Pixel 7a does a little better on the CPU-taxing Geekbench 5's multi-core portion and the Wild Life Unlimited GPU test, it lags behind on the Adobe Premiere Rush video transcoding test. Clearly Google's done some tinkering to keep parts of the Pixel 7 ahead of the cheaper upstart.

Another difference the Pixel 7 still comes off best in is storage. You only get a 128GB option on the Pixel 7a, but the Pixel 7 can offer 256GB if you pay an extra $100.

Battery life is one area where we hoped the Pixel 7a does stand out from its more expensive sibling. And it certainly seems to, although looking at only the new model's slightly larger 4,385 mAh battery (compared to the Pixel 7's 3,355 mAh battery) undersells the gap.

On our custom battery test, the Pixel 7a managed to last 10 hours and 5 minutes in 60Hz mode (the default), while the Pixel 7 got to 7 hours and 30 minutes in the same mode. We're still waiting for 90Hz test results, but it looks like Google's made huge strides in efficiency for the Pixel 7a.

The Pixel 7a gained wireless charging for the first time too, bringing it in line with the Pixel 7. The 7 still wins on speed though, able to charge at 21W when plugged in compared to the Pixel 7a's 18W.

While the Pixel 7a is newer than the Pixel 7, it still ships with the same Android 13 OS. Android 14 won't be ready for another few months, but both phones should get access to it quite quickly after launch.

As noted above, the Tensor G2 is found in both phones, which means all the Pixel 7's software features are on hand in the Pixel 7a. That means the budget phone supports Photo Unblur (which uses AI to unblur faces in photos — even ones it didn't shoot), plus other abilities like call management and live translation.

It's hard to explain just what the extra $100 you'd pay for a Pixel 7 gets you over the Pixel 7a. Unless its photos come back remarkably better than the cheaper phone, the flagship Pixel's only advantages are screen size, potential storage capacity and a few performance parameters.

Meanwhile, the Pixel 7a looks like an incredible value phone, offering the same refresh rate and display quality as its big sibling along with improved battery life and a new suite of cameras. It even looks pretty much the same as the Pixel 7.

If we were spending our own money, the Pixel 7a looks like the smarter bet right now. But the canniest smartphone buyers may want to hold off on upgrading until the end of the year to see what the Pixel 8 changes about Google's flagship phone line. It'll likely offer several new features that may make you regret picking up a Pixel 7a early.

Text: Not long ago, there were plenty of compelling reasons to spend upward of $900 on a smartphone. Nowadays, you’ll have to come up with an excuse to pay that much.

I ran out of reasons to splurge and stopped buying fancier phones with the “Pro” moniker over the past two years. That’s not just because I’m frugal. Cheaper phones have increasingly become indistinguishable from high-end ones, and the few features that set them apart rarely justify the extra cost.

Google’s new budget phone that arrives in stores this week, the Pixel 7A, is the latest testament to the maturation of the smartphone market, and it presents an opportunity to save money. The entry-level handset, priced at $500, is in many ways on par with its premium counterpart, the Pixel 7 Pro, which cost $900. And based on my testing for a week, I would recommend the budget model for most Android users.

Bear with me as I break from the tradition of reviewing a phone’s features. Putting the Pixel 7A’s value into perspective requires a history lesson on smartphones.

Text: For a few years now, the Pixel A line has been one of the best deals in smartphones. It’s a budget take on an already low-priced product. It starts with a foundation of premium components, discovering ways to reduce cost without — hopefully — stripping too much of what made the premium product good in the first place.

It’s a strategy that’s served Google well. When the company was struggling to sell Pixel devices, it was the A series that helped it dig itself out of a hole. It’s a move that’s allowed the company to expand into additional markets, including — most notably — India, the world’s second largest smartphone market, where premium-priced flagships are often a hard sell.

Each fall, Google releases a new flagship, using the latest and greatest hardware to showcase some of the AI software tricks it’s been cooking up. In the spring around AI, it issues a budget device that utilizes its latest silicon in a cheaper package. The materials are different, the camera hardware isn’t as strong. Superficially, the device bears more than a passing resemblance to its more premium counterpart, but like all good budget devices, there’s not a lot the average user will miss.

This is the promise of the Pixel 7a, which was unveiled today alongside the Pixel Tablet and Pixel Fold onstage at the Google I/O kick-off keynote. Seeing as how we’re talking about a budget device, the first thing to note here is the price. The device runs $499. That’s $100 less than the Pixel 7. It’s also $50 more than the Pixel 6a, which is not an insignificant price bump — particularly in the world of budget devices.

Keeping it (only just technically) “below” $500 is a symbolic victory, as far as the classification of budget handsets go. What’s always been a bit tricky for the line is that the standard Pixel is already quite affordable — $600 in a world of $1,000 devices. Of course, if you want the real flagship, you’ll need to look at the 7 Pro. That device is $900. So its 3x the price jump between the 7 and 7 Pro than the 7a and 7.

At the end of the day, however, Google recognizes that the A-line played an outsized role in helping the company gain a foothold in the mobile world. It always tends to sell well, but if the more expensive device cannibalizes the cheaper one due to better hardware, a six-month head start and relatively small price gulf between models, so be it. At the end of the day, that simply means more money for Google.

If money is still a major hurdle, the company is also keeping the Pixel 6a around with a $100 price drop, putting it at a very affordable $349.

Top line, the biggest edition is the Tensor G2. It’s the second generation of Google’s in-house silicon, which was introduced alongside the Pixel 7 (though, as Frederic noted, it wasn’t a huge advance over the G1). It powers all three of the devices launching today and is the foundation of a growing Pixel hardware ecosystem that also includes the Pixel Watch and various iterations of Pixel Buds. That’s coupled with 8GB of RAM, which you also get with the 7 — ditto for the 128GB of storage. The Pro, on the other hand, sports 12GB of RAM, while the storage runs up to 512GB.

Tensor has, thus far, failed to keep apace with Snapdragon. That’s to be expected, really. Google has no shortage of money or smart people working on the project, but Qualcomm has a significant head start. And while the benchmarks can’t touch the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, the performance is good for a budget or mid-tier system, which is the context in which it should be considered on the 7a.

Perhaps most important in terms of day to day use, the new chip enabled key imaging features like Face Unblur to sharpen images and Super Res Zoom. Other Google-specific imaging features include Magic Eraser, Night Sight and Real Tone for skin colors. The 7a is getting both, though the latter is limited to 8x versus the Pro’s 30x.

The 7a maintains the dual rear-facing camera setup, though both get a megapixel bump over the 7 from 50 to 64 on the wide camera and 12 to 13 megapixels on the ultrawide. The rear setup is capable of shooting 4K video at 60FPS. The 13-megapixel front-facing camera, meanwhile, can do 4K at 30FPS. I really miss the flexibility and zoom of the 7 Pro, but I was able to grab some nice shots around my neighborhood with the 7a’s cameras.

The 7a’s displays is 6.1 inches to the 7’s 6.3. Both are 1080 x 2400, which means the 7a actually has the (slightly) higher pixel density of the two. It also adopts the 7’s 90Hz refresh rate. The system has the same battery rating as the 7 — “up to 24 hours” with standard use and “up to 72 hours” with the Extreme Battery setting — meaning it’s likely the same (or very similar) 4355 mAh inside.

The Pixel 7a launches tomorrow in the U. S., Canada, U.K., Ireland, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Norway, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Japan, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan and India. Here in the States, it will run you $499.

All in all, a nice edition to the line that doesn’t make too many meaningful sacrifices to the original 7 in order to keep the price down. A more meaningful price difference would have helped further distinguish the devices, but that can be a tricky line to walk.

Text: Following seemingly endless leaks, rumors, and teases, the Google Pixel 7a is finally here. Like other Pixel A device before it, the Pixel 7a has a clear goal on paper: Deliver a high-quality Google Pixel smartphone experience for less money than its more expensive siblings.

On its own, the Pixel 7a is a very good smartphone. It has a nice design, great specs, a reliable camera system, and is pretty easy on the wallet at just $499. But when the more capable Pixel 7 offers a few noteworthy upgrades for $599 — and last year’s Pixel 6a is sticking around at a reduced price — it puts the Pixel 7a in a tough spot. Here’s our full review.

The design of the Pixel 7a is just like its predecessor, with a few minor differences. You still have a high gloss plastic back that looks like glass until you touch it, and an aluminum frame surrounds the edges. Unlike the Pixel 6a’s frame, though, which had an anodized metallic black finish, the aluminum frame of the Pixel 7a matches the color of the device that you choose. For my Snow review unit, the frame is silver.

With the Pixel 6a, you could tell that it was the cheaper Pixel because it also featured plastic on the camera bar. But the Pixel 7a now features a metallic camera bar, similar to what you’ll find on the standard Pixel 7, just a little thinner (probably due to the smaller sensors).

The Pixel 7a is also a smidge taller and wider than the Pixel 6a, but you won’t notice the difference unless you have them stacked on top of one another. Product dimensions for the Pixel 7a are 72.9 x 152.4 x 9.0mm, whereas the 6a is 71.8 by 152.2 by 8.9mm. The Pixel 7a also weighs a little more at 193 grams compared to the previous 178 grams. Despite the very minor differences in size, the Pixel 7a still has the same display size at 6.1 inches, making it the most compact of the Pixel 7 lineup.

Because of the slightly smaller size of the Pixel 7a, it’s more comfortable to hold than the Pixel 7. However, as someone who prefers smaller-sized phones in general, I wish the Pixel 7a was still the same physical size as its predecessor, which was a bit easier for me to hold comfortably. But overall, the design of the Pixel 7a is pretty much the same as other Pixels, just made with high gloss plastic on the back rather than Gorilla Glass Victus.

Lastly, Google claims that the Pixel 7a is one of the most durable Pixel A-series devices yet. It has an IP67 rating, so it can handle water and dust without an issue. The front display is also covered with Corning Gorilla Glass 3, so it’s scratch resistant.

That’s not a bad setup by any means, but seeing how Gorilla Glass 3 was released in 2013 and has been replaced by five newer versions since, its presence on the Pixel 6a does feel a bit dated.

And, no, the Pixel 7a does not have a headphone jack.

The Pixel 7a has the same screen size as the Pixel 6a, which is 6.1 inches. It’s also a Full HD OLED display with a 1080 x 2400 resolution, a 20:9 aspect ratio, and has Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for durability. However, Google made some minor improvements to make the Pixel 7a slightly better.

Previous Pixel A-series devices have had a 60Hz refresh rate, which was typical for budget phones a while back. But the new Pixel 7a has been bumped up to a smoother 90Hz adaptive refresh rate, dubbed “Smooth Display.” It’s the same setting that you find in the regular Pixel 7, which also has a 90Hz refresh rate.

With the increased refresh rate for the display, you can expect smoother scrolling, animations, and better graphics when gaming. However, the Smooth Display setting is disabled by default, so you have to enable it manually. This is probably due to the poor battery life that the Pixel 7a has (a higher refresh rate decreases battery life), which we’ll get to in a bit.

On the inside, Google packed in the newer Tensor G2 chip, which is an improvement over the first-generation Tensor in the Pixel 6a. You also have 8GB RAM (the 6a only had 6GB), and once again, the only storage option is 128GB.

On paper, the specs for the Pixel 7a definitely look impressive for a phone of this price range, but it’s not a terribly big upgrade from what you can get with the Pixel 6a. Yes, the 90Hz refresh rate certainly helps, but I feel like it may not be too noticeable for most people who want an affordable budget phone, as the Pixel 6a is still a good buy. And the extra RAM helps, but it’s still pretty negligible in daily use.

During my testing with the Pixel 7a, the phone handles my everyday tasks quite well. This includes checking email and messages on Microsoft Teams, endlessly scrolling through Instagram and Facebook, checking Mastodon, lots of camera use and photo editing, using an app for sharing a million images of my toddler daughter with family, watching streaming video and YouTube, checking the news, and some light, casual gaming. The Pixel 7a handles all of these tasks well without skipping a beat.

I’m also quite impressed with how fast the cameras are able to capture a scene. I’ve used the Pixel 7a to take a bunch of photos of my toddler, who can barely sit or stand still (other parents can understand my plight, right?), and the resulting images came out very nicely. Tensor G2 definitely helps with the fast capture on the Pixel 7a.

You get Android 13 out of the box with the Pixel 7a, just like with the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. Also, like the standard Pixel 7 lineup, the Pixel 7a will get three years of OS upgrades and five years of security patches.

At this point, Android 13 is pretty mature, and Android 14 is peeping over the horizon. Android 13 is the first Android version I’ve really dived into, and I’ve been quite enjoying it on the Pixel 7a — especially since this is the “pure” version of Android, without various manufacturer skins layered on top.

Android 13, without any custom fork, is simple and clean. I’m a big fan of Google’s Material You theme engine, as it makes customizing your device a breeze with wallpapers and matching color themes, and even dynamic third-party icons that can match your chosen color palette.

Google’s Tensor chip also makes a lot of the AI features on the Pixel 7a very appealing, and a big reason to consider the Pixel 7a — or any Pixel for that matter. For example, Magic Eraser works wonderfully, and you have access to features like Google Assistant on phone calls to hold your place in line and more.

Overall, the software on the Pixel 7a runs well, thanks to the performance boost Google gave it in terms of specs. It’s fast, responsive, and easy to use. If you’re a fan of the stock Android experience, then you can’t go wrong with the Pixel 7a.

Even though the Pixel 7a is the budget phone of the Pixel 7 lineup, Google decided to give it some impressive camera hardware — even surpassing the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro in some aspects.

There’s a 64MP main camera on the Pixel 7a and a 13MP ultrawide sensor. For comparison, the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro both have a 50MP main camera and a 12MP ultrawide camera. However, Google claims that despite the Pixel 7a having a higher megapixel count than its siblings, the sensor is not as large as the one on the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro. This means that the Pixel 7a may not be as good when it comes to capturing low-light images.

With the Google Pixel 6a, you already could take some great photos without much effort, and that was just with a reliable 12MP camera. In my time with the Pixel 7a, I’m really impressed with the image quality. The 64MP camera is nothing to sneeze at, as it captures incredibly detailed and sharp photos without looking too over-processed. The colors are also vivid and punchy but without the over-saturation that you get with most Samsung phones, or harsh colors that I always get on my iPhone 14 Pro when it’s super bright out.

Even when it was a bit cloudy and overcast out, the Pixel 7a handled these not-so-great lighting conditions well, and the pictures came out great, despite the circumstances. And again, with the Tensor G2 chip powering it, the Pixel 7a is very quick to snap a photo, as I’m able to capture good images even when my toddler is on the move.

The selfie camera on the Pixel 7a is also a big step up from its predecessor with its 8MP camera, as well as the base model Pixel 7, which only has a 10.8MP front camera. On the Pixel 7a, you have a 13MP selfie camera. I think the Pixel 7a takes some excellent selfies that are detailed and with just the right amount of bokeh going on in the background when you snap them in Portrait mode (this also applies to Portrait images with the rear camera).

Skin tones still seem to be a bit of a hit or miss, though, depending on the lighting at the time. Sometimes it seemed to capture my skin tone correctly, and other times I looked a tad paler than I actually am. But when the skin tone is accurate, the images look splendid. Lowlight images are not great, though. While they’re acceptable, you can definitely see that the details are very soft, and the colors may appear a bit washed out. This is definitely where the larger sensors on the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro would come in handy.

Unfortunately, battery life is the Pixel 7a’s weakest point. Since the Pixel A-series is the smallest of the Pixel lineup, it typically has the smallest battery to go alongside the physical size. With the Pixel 7a, you get a 4,385mAh battery, which is actually less than its predecessor’s 4,410mAh battery, though it’s on par with the Pixel 7’s 4,355mAh one. Once again, Google claims that the Pixel 7a is a 24-hour smartphone, though you can extend it to 72 hours by using the Extreme Battery Saver setting.

Pixels have never been known to have great battery life, and this is especially true with the Pixel 7a. My usage with the Pixel 7a has been what I would consider light to medium use since I’ve primarily just been using the device on Wi-Fi. I do use it for checking email, work messages, social media, taking photos and editing them, watching videos and streaming music, web browsing, and other everyday tasks. Nothing heavy or super resource intensive, but I notice that the battery just continually drains, even if it’s just sitting on my desk.

If this were my primary phone, I definitely don’t see it lasting more than a day with heavy use. Even when I was just out taking photos with the Pixel 7a, the battery would drain faster than I’d like, and it also tends to get warm. It doesn’t appear that the Tensor G2 chip did a lot of improving on the power efficiency front, unfortunately.

The Pixel 7a caps out at 18W fast charging through a USB-C cable, so it’s not the fastest option out there. For example, the Samsung Galaxy S23 has a smaller 3,900mAh battery (but oddly enough, battery life seems to be better with it) but has fast charging at 25W. The standard Pixel 7 is not much better than the Pixel 7a, as it’s only 20W wired charging. Getting the phone from zero to 100% takes a little over 1.5 hours.

Google did add wireless charging to the Pixel 7a, though, which is a first. Unfortunately, it’s much slower than even the regular Pixel 7, as it is just 7.5W with Qi-compatible wireless chargers, though you’ll get slightly faster wireless speeds if you use Google’s Pixel Stand accessory. Unlike the Pixel 7, there is no reverse wireless charging (Battery Share).

While Google made improvements to the Pixel 7a by adding wireless charging capabilities, it also took two steps backward by having a smaller battery capacity than the Pixel 6a and also making the wireless charging speed much slower than the regular Pixel 7, with no Battery Share option either.

The Google Pixel 7a is available for purchase right now for $499. You can buy it directly from Google, retailers like Amazon and Best Buy, and wireless carriers. The Pixel 7a comes in four colors: Charcoal, Snow, Sea, and the Google Store-exclusive Coral.

The pricing of the Pixel 7a puts it in an odd place and makes it difficult to recommend — especially considering that the Pixel 6a continues to be sold at a new low price of $349.

If you are looking for the most affordable Pixel phone, the Pixel 6a is tough to beat, especially since it’s still a great device. But if you want more megapixels, higher refresh rate, and wireless charging, then the Pixel 7a is better — until you see that the Pixel 7 is just $100 more and offers larger camera sensors, a slightly better battery, reverse wireless charging, and an overall better AMOLED display.

It’s a bit of a pickle for the Pixel 7a. If the Pixel 6a were discontinued, then it would be easier to recommend the Pixel 7a, but that isn’t the case.

If you’re looking at the Pixel 7a by itself, it’s a pretty capable device for just $499. It’s the smallest of the Pixel 7 lineup, but the 6.1-inch display looks good with vibrant colors and rich blacks, and the 90Hz refresh rate makes scrolling and gaming better. You get Android 13 powered by the Tensor G2 chip, so everything runs smoothly and is quite snappy and responsive, especially with the 8GB RAM.

You also get an impressive 64MP main camera and 13MP ultrawide lens, and thanks to the Tensor G2 chip, the camera app is pretty fast when it comes to capturing photos, even when your subject is in motion. Plus, this is the first time that the Pixel A-series has wireless charging.

However, keep in mind that though the camera has a higher megapixel count than the regular Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, the sensors on the Pixel 7a are smaller, so lowlight images won’t turn out as well. And battery life is far from great, and wireless charging is quite slow.

And when you look at the Pixel 7a among the competition, it becomes much harder to recommend. If you are wanting a super affordable Pixel, then the Pixel 6a is still being sold with a large price cut, now costing just $349 (down from $449). Though the display only has a 60Hz refresh rate, and the main camera is 12MP, it’s still a very reliable phone and certainly not a bad device at all — even more so at that new, low price.

If you want a Pixel that offers more, then there is also the Pixel 7, which is just $100 more ($599) than the Pixel 7a. You’ll have a slightly larger display at 6.3 inches, the same 90Hz refresh rate, Android 13 with Tensor G2, and 8GB RAM with 128GB storage. But while the Pixel 7 only has a 50MP main camera, it still has larger sensors that can handle low light photos better, faster wireless charging, and also Battery Share reverse wireless charging.

Another option in the price range of the Pixel 7a  is the Samsung Galaxy A54. For just $450, you’ll get a crisp 6.4-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, which already blows the Pixel 7a out of the water. Samsung’s Exynos 1380 processor is fast and snappy with Android 13/One UI 5.1, there’s 6GB/8GB RAM with 128GB storage and the option for expandable storage with microSD, a 50MP main camera, and a 5,000mAh battery with 25W charging speeds (but no wireless charging). Of course, Samsung phones are known for over-saturated and bright colors in photos that may not be super realistic, so that’s one factor to consider. But otherwise, the Galaxy A54 is a great buy.

Again, the Pixel 7a is a good device on its own, but when you take a look at the other options available — especially in similar price ranges or the rest of the Pixel lineup — it’s a hard sell. It’s far from a bad phone, just a misguided one.

Text: Now that the Google Pixel 7a is available to purchase, we have a retail unit in the house to join our review queue. We already handled Google's newest midranger, so this will be more of a quick unboxing as we start the 7a's full review.

The phone comes with a USB-C to USB-A adapter, and a USB-C cable. Google ships the Pixel 7a with a  30W charger in some countries like France and Germany. If you purchase the phone by May 22, you'll get a complimentary Pixel Buds A-Series for free or the €219 Pixel Buds Pro for €110.

We have the Sea-colored Pixel 7a but there are also the flashy Coral as well as the more subdued Black and White versions. This is a typical Pixel phone from the front with thick bezels around the display and a very slight curve, similar to the Pixel 7.

However, while the Pixel 7 has a slightly bigger 6.3-inch display, the Pixel 7a has a 6.1-inch panel. Otherwise, it's a similar 1080p panel with a 90Hz refresh rate. The display is nice and punchy. It does arrive pre-set to 60Hz and you might want to change that to 90Hz to enjoy a much smoother experience.

One of the key differences between the Pixel 7a and the 7 is the plastic rear panel on the 7a. It's not a noticeable difference in looks, feel, or weight, though it will likely scratch more easily.

The cameras are a bit different as well. It's still a wide and ultrawide setup, but the Pixel 7 has bigger sensors on both and slightly wider apertures.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a review: the best mid-range phone gets even better

Text: Google’s latest mid-range phone brings high-end features down to a reasonable price, including the firm’s top chip and class-leading camera.

The Pixel 7a costs £449 (€509/$449) – £50 more than the initial price of last year’s 6a but £150 cheaper than the Pixel 7 – while offering almost the same features.

In fact, it looks almost identical to the 7, just ever so slightly smaller. It has a nice and bright 6.1in OLED screen with an upgraded 90Hz refresh rate to keep things smooth when scrolling. The phone is a good size and easy to fit in a pocket but with a big-enough screen for watching video on the commute.

New for this year is face unlock for the phone as well as a fingerprint scanner. It is a good combination, adding the convenience of face recognition for unlocking the phone in good light while keeping the secure authentication via your fingerprint for banking apps and similar. The fingerprint scanner isn’t the fastest on the market but generally works fine if you are precise with the initial scans of your finger during setup.

Google has stuck with the same recipe that made the Pixel 6a a winner last year. The new phone has the firm’s top Tensor G2 chip from the Pixel 7 and the same amount of RAM and storage. That makes the 7a faster and more powerful than the mid-range competition and on-par with top-end phones.

The battery lasts about 34 hours between charges, which is generally enough for the heaviest of days. It will need charging overnight, similar to its predecessor and the Pixel 7.

Google does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairable by Google and third-party shops with genuine replacement parts available direct from iFixit.

The Pixel 7a is made with recycled aluminium, glass and plastic, accounting for about 21% of the phone by weight. The company publishes environmental impact reports for some of its products. Google will recycle old devices free of charge.

The Pixel 7a runs the same version of Android 13 as the Pixel 7 Pro and Google’s other smartphones. It is fast, well optimised and good-looking, and includes free access to Google’s VPN, which is handy for securing your data while using public wifi networks.

Google provides at least five years of software and security updates including at least three major Android versions. Samsung supports many of its phones for five years, while Fairphone is aiming for six years and Apple supports its iPhone for up to seven years.

On the back there are new 64 megapixel main and 13MP ultrawide cameras, which improve on the already great Pixel 6a and bring the phone into line with the more expensive Pixel 7.

The main camera shoots really good, well-exposed and dramatic images, with excellent levels of detail in good outdoor and dim indoor lighting. It does a particularly good job of capturing detail in portraits and photos of objects.

The ultrawide camera is also one of the better options available, slightly weaker on detail and sharpness than the main camera, but managing high contrast and difficult scenes with aplomb. The 7a has no telephoto camera, instead relying on digital zoom, which is fine at 2x but starts to markedly degrade much beyond 3 or 4x zoom.

The 13MP selfie camera is equally excellent, while video captured across all three cameras is good for the money. New for this year is a fun long-exposure mode for adding a bit of motion to photos and a significantly faster low-light mode, which can make near darkness look like daylight.

Overall, the 7a is a step up over last year’s 6a and about on a par with the more expensive Pixel 7. It totally trounces the mid-range competition anywhere near this price.

For comparison, the Pixel 7 costs from £599, the Pixel 6a now costs £349, the Samsung Galaxy A54 costs £449, the Nothing Phone 1 costs £349 and the Apple iPhone SE costs £449.

The Pixel 7a is the best mid-range Android phone available. It squeezes even more of the premium smartphone experience into a smaller, cheaper model.

Google’s top chip, plenty of RAM and a decent amount of storage, make it faster than most competitors. Its great, bright screen has a 90Hz refresh rate to keep things smooth when scrolling, which is a major perk of high-end phones alongside wireless charging.

Great software and five years of support mean you can keep using it for longer. The camera is class leading and then some, beating many phones twice the price and totally trouncing the competition in the mid-range.

The back is plastic not glass, though most will put it in a case anyway. The 34-hour battery is solid enough for a good day but short of the best.

But the 7a is so good for the money, I’m not sure why you’d pay an extra £150 for the Pixel 7. In fact, the 7a’s biggest problem is that the Pixel 6a is still on sale from last year and is now reduced to £349, which is tremendous value.

Pros: brilliant camera, excellent smaller screen, top performance, decent battery life, wireless charging, face and fingerprint unlock, water resistance, recycled aluminium and plastic, five years of security updates, Android 13, smart software features, competitively priced.

Cons: no optical zoom or macro photo mode, face unlock option not as secure as some rivals, battery life short of best-in-class, fairly slow charging.

Text: The Google Pixel 7a is official after months of leaks, and a few teasers from Google itself. It's the only new device shown at Google I/O that's already up for sale, and if you've been waiting for a seemingly ideal balance of features and pricing, then this could be the smartphone you've been looking for.

Google's made some big upgrades to the Pixel 7a's performance, display, cameras and charging, although you have to pay a bit more in return. Read our freshly baked Google Pixel 7a review to see how Google's latest phone matches up with Google's own Pixel 7, as well as rivals like the Galaxy A54 or the iPhone SE, and if it's worthy of being named one of the best Android phones or best cheap phones, if not both.

Read more about the Google Pixel Fold and the Pixel Tablet, also announced today at Google I/O.

You can buy the Pixel 7a from today, with sales officially kicking off during Google I/O. You'll be able to buy the single 8GB RAM/128GB storage variant from your favorite retailers and cell carriers, but Google may tempt you to buy it from them with a unique color option (more on that below).

Google's charging $499/£449 for the Pixel 7a, a little higher than the $449/£399 you'd have paid for the Pixel 6a at launch, but still cheaper than the regular Pixel 7 at $599. That's despite the 7 and 7a sharing many features in common, making for a tricky buying decision for those with wiggle room in their budget.

The Pixel 6a is staying on sale for $349 though, so if the new price point is too rich for your blood, you've got an alternative.

The Pixel 7a follows Google's current design language faithfully, with a central punch hole display on the front and prominent horizontal camera bar on the back. It also continues Google's use of aluminum sides (100% recycled for eco creds) and a thermoformed plastic back for materials, but should now be more durable against drops thanks to a new mid-frame. It's rated for IP67 dust/water resistance like the Pixel 6, which while not as good as the Pixel 7 series' IP68 rating, should still mean you have nothing to fear from drops into water or dirt.

Google's widened the choice of colors for this year's Pixel a-series model. You can pick up a 7a in Charcoal (black), Snow (white) or Sea (pale blue) from most retailers, while buying directly from Google also gives you a bright orange Coral option.

For display duties, Google has stuck with a 6.1-inch FHD OLED display for the Pixel 7a, except now it comes with a 90Hz refresh rate. This is the first time Google's brought a refresh rate above 60Hz to the Pixel a-series, and while it's not as fast as the 120Hz of select mid-priced phones like the Samsung Galaxy A54, it's still better than the Pixel 6a, and the 60Hz iPhone SE.

The annoying thing is that 90Hz is disabled by default. That could mean that Google's generous battery life estimates - over 24 hours by default and up to 72 hours on a charge with Extreme Battery Saver mode enabled - may not be accurate if you want to enable one of the phone's biggest upgrades over its predecessor.

The Pixel 7a features an impressive-sounding 64MP main camera, which Google claims is 72% larger than the 12MP main camera on the Pixel 6a. It's also the highest-res camera seen on a Pixel to date, beating the 50MP sensor seen on the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro.

Joining it is a refreshed 13MP ultrawide camera, and a front 13MP selfie snapper. All three of these cameras are capable of recording 4K video, at 60fps for the main camera and 30fps for the ultrawide and selfie ones.

There's no zoom camera (as is typical for phones in this price range) but Google's boasting an upgraded Super Res Zoom for the Pixel 7a. Thanks to the 64MP sensor, you'll be able to crop in at an effective 8x magnification.

Added to that is Google's excellent photography software toolbox, featuring handy abilities like Photo Unblur and Magic Eraser, plus a new Long Exposure mode for artfully blurred shots. Night Sight, Google's low-light mode, is also back, and is allegedly twice as fast and sharp as the Pixel 6a's version.

Running things under the Pixel 7a's hood is the same Tensor G2 chipset from the Pixel 7 series. It's paired with 8GB RAM (yet another first) and 128GB storage, which is on par with rival phones. Hopefully the Tensor chip can also turn out some impressive scores for a mid-range phone too, as devices at this price (iPhone SE excluded) tend to use some rather anemic chips. It may even be capable of beating the Pixel 7 on benchmarks, according to alleged pre-release results.

Whenever the Pixel does run out of battery, you'll be able to fill it with either a wired adapter at up to 18W, or with 7.5W wireless charging, another first for a Pixel a-series phone. The battery itself has a 4,385 mAh capacity, which is a touch less than the 4,410 mAh cell the Pixel 6a uses, but hopefully won't impact battery life too badly.

A Pixel phone wouldn't be a Pixel without a bunch of exclusive Android features, and sure enough the Pixel 7a offers the features you'd expect, such as Call Assist, Clear Calling and Direct My Call. For your security needs, there's under-display fingerprint unlocking, along with Face Unlock for added convenience like the Pixel 7. You're guaranteed more Pixel-only features in the future too, thanks to Google's Feature Drop updates.

One apparently unique feature for the Pixel 7a, not yet seen on other Pixels, is an adaptive vibration setting that will minimize the phone's buzzing when it's still and screen-up.

We're very impressed with what the Pixel 7a offers on paper. While Google maintains that the cameras on the Pixel 7, plus its faster charging, battery size and materials are higher quality, the 7a still feels like a steal in comparison. We're keen to see how the Pixel 7a vs Pixel 7 face-off turns out in the coming days.

We'll also be interested in how the match-up of Pixel 7a vs. Samsung Galaxy A54 turns out. The Samsung phone offers a bigger and smoother display, plus an extra camera round the back, but Google's software and processor could mean it ends up the better phone overall.

The biggest question perhaps however is how the Pixel 7a and the Pixel 6a compare. With its new cheaper price, the 6a may be too good to pass up even when taking the Pixel 7a's upgrades into account. However with just $100 between them, it could be fairly easy to justify the extra expense for a phone that will get updates for at least a year longer.

The outlook's bright for the Pixel 7a however you cut it. Make sure to take a look at our Pixel 7a review when it arrives, and also at Google I/O's other two big hardware announcements: the Google Pixel Fold and the Pixel Tablet.

The Pixel 7a is the phone that many wanted the Pixel 7 to be last year. At under $500, it is the phone that most Android fans should buy unless they absolutely need a telephoto lens or top-tier gaming performance. Google’s value-based dominance continues.

Why you can trust Laptop Mag

Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

Yes, the Google Pixel 7a is $50 more expensive than its predecessor, which you never like to see for a brand’s budget phone, but as I’ll cover in detail throughout the review, you are getting so much more than $50 in value out of the upgrades to this phone.

The Pixel 7a is the phone that many wanted the Pixel 7 to be last year. It’s slightly smaller at 6.1 inches, but matches the 90Hz display of its flagship counterpart and the OLED panel eclipses its big sibling in every metric that we test. It may not be 120Hz, but I’m not sure if there’s a better display on a phone anywhere near this price.

Google also finally updated the cameras, after squeezing every last ounce of life out of the 12MP cameras that have been kicking around Pixel phones for about half a decade now, the new primary 64MP Quad Bayer sensor in the Pixel 7a gives the budget Pixel the hardware to match its competitor trashing computational photography.

Is this the perfect phone? No, the speakers are mediocre and certain users will be able to hit the ceiling of the Tensor G2’s performance, but this is unquestionably one of the best phones on the market, and that’s before factoring in that it’s just $499.

The Google Pixel 7a only comes in one configuration for $499 and it features a Google Tensor G2 chip, 8GB of LPDDR5 RAM, and 128GB of UFS 3.1 storage.

The only choice you can make with the Pixel 7a is to select from one of these colors:  Charcoal, Sea, Snow, or Coral. Given that it’s a budget phone that’s not a bad little color wheel to choose from.

The much-feared Pixel 7a price increase rumors were correct, so while it’s still one of the best values at $499, it’s hard not to feel wistful for the early days of the Pixel A series with the Pixel 3a and Pixel 4a coming in at $399 and $349, respectively. The pricing also comes as a slight shock given that the Pixel 7 has spent the majority of 2023 at $449 or $499, I even called it the best smartphone under $500 last month, but take a look around now and it’s back up between $540 and $599.

There are already some enticing pre-order deals for the Pixel 7a and I wouldn’t count on it remaining at full price too often given past Pixel pricing, but I strongly suspect this also means we won’t be getting a $599 Pixel 8 this fall. Google can still say that Pixel is a value-base

Have you seen a Pixel phone released in the last two years? If you answered yes, then you’ve got a pretty good idea of what to expect from the Pixel 7a. For those of you that have been on a Pixel-free diet since 2020, the Pixel 7a features a fairly traditional slab design with rounded “tactile alloy” edges, but a 3D thermoformed composite back. Fancy terminology aside the back feels like plastic, while the sides feel like metal.

The one place where things get wild is the full-width camera array, made from that same “tactile alloy,” which draws comparisons to Geordi La Forge’s visor from Star Trek: The Next Generation or maybe Cyclops's visor from X-men. It’s divisive, but I still prefer it to the endless sea of samey design that otherwise exists in the non-foldable phone world. Beyond a preference for its unique styling of it, one of my personal peccadillos is also partly to blame. I like to be able to set a phone down without a case and not have it wobble all over the place, Google’s camera bar is the only current design that gets a gold star in that regard.

Another divisive move by Google since the Pixel 6 is the “big or bigger?” options when it comes to its flagship phones. The Pixel 7 features a 6.3-inch display, while the Pixel 7 Pro bumps up to 6.7 inches. Not exactly pocket-friendly for all, so thankfully the Pixel 7a comes in at a manageable 6.1 inches. That translates to 6 x 2.8 x 0.4 inches and just 6.8 ounces. The Pixel 7 gets a little taller and wider at 6.1 x 2.9 x 0.34 inches and 7 ounces. Neither can hold a candle to the diminutive size of the iPhone SE 2022 at 5.2 x 2.5 x 0.3 inches and 5 ounces, but that’s the result of its Lilliputian 4.7-inch display.

The Pixel 7a gets IP67 dust and water resistance, that’s complete protection against dust and enough to hold back water in complete submersion up to 3 feet (1 meter). This is a step below the IP68 rating of the Pixel 7 but matches up exactly with its affordable iPhone counterpart.

The Google Pixel 7a display is equal to or better than the Pixel 7 display in every regard save for the smaller 6.1-inch size. It’s an OLED with an FHD+ (2400 x 1080) resolution and a 90Hz adaptive refresh rate. And while I knew it looked good from the moment I took it out of the box, it’s always nice to see our lab tests back up those first impressions. While there are sub-$500 phones with 120Hz displays, I don’t find the difference between 90 and 120Hz to be that perceptible and the output from this panel is remarkable.

I watched the latest trailer for Oppenheimer downloaded in 1080p from HD-trailers.net to get a feel for what the display offers. Christopher Nolan’s visuals did not disappoint on the smartphone display. I was struck by the vibrancy and sharp detail throughout, but a cross-fade from a push-in close-up on Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to the initial test explosion was a showcase for what the Pixel 7a display can do. You see every pore of Murphy’s weathered face, the brilliant blue of his haunted eyes, and then it’s subsumed by rolling clouds of orange flames and white sparks before fading to inky blackness.

The Google Pixel 7a was outstanding in our lab testing, particularly considering its value pricing. It reproduced 92% of the DCI-P3 color gamut on its default Adaptive display setting and 79.1% in its Natural setting. That was enough for a victory over the Pixel 7 (77%), the iPhone SE 2022 (81%), and the smartphone average (88%).

The Delta-E color accuracy test results (lower is better) for the Pixel 7a, were the best we’ve ever seen at 0.05. None of the competition came close with the iPhone SE 2022 (0.21) next up, followed by the smartphone average (0.24), and finally the Pixel 7 (0.28).

If you were worried that the Google Pixel 7a’s display dominance would stop at brightness, fear not, with a peak of 1,024 nits on its HDR setting it again eclipsed the Pixel 7 (926 nits), the iPhone SE 2022 (596 nits), and the smartphone average (979 nits).

I have to stress how impressive it is that the Pixel 7a managed a clean sweep on the smartphone averages with its display given that the majority of the smartphones we review are at least double the cost of the Pixel 7a.

If the Google Pixel 7a has a weakness it's the stereo speakers, which are serviceable, but nothing special. At top volume, you start to get some distracting reverberation, so keep it to around 75% to enjoy the best it has to offer.

I listened to “How to Save a Life” by The Fray because apparently YouTube Music wanted me in a melancholy mood when I opened up the trending rock charts. While the moody tune isn’t particularly bass-heavy, the steady backing percussion lacked any punch. The vocals were crisp and clear (well as crisp and clear as they were recorded) and the light touch on the piano was well produced. If you are like me and your phone’s speakers are typically just playing back a video or spoken word content like a podcast then this won’t matter to you at all, for anything else pick up a good pair of wireless headphones.

The Pixel 7a gains the Tensor G2 chip that debuted in the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro last year, and it remains a bit of a conundrum. For daily usage, I never notice any slowdowns, and particularly when reviewing a phone I can be a frenetic user that is jumping in and out of apps all while running a YouTube video in the background.

I fired up Call of Duty: Mobile and the Pixel 7a kept pace with that fairly strenuous game without skipping any frames. Now there are absolutely better phones for gaming, so if you are doing more than just casual gaming on your phone you might want to consider something like the Galaxy S23 Ultra or OnePlus 11, but for occasional gamers, it won’t hold you back.

With all that said, the Tensor G2 remains consistently underwhelming at benchmarks. In the Geekbench 5.4 performance test, it hit 3,065. That’s marginally better than the Pixel 7 (3,021), but well behind the smartphone average (3,885) and of course the iPhone SE 2022 (4,482).

Graphics benchmarks were more of a mixed bag. In the 3DMark Sling Shot Extreme test it hit 8,824, only slightly behind the Pixel 7 (8,850) and the smartphone average (8,862). However, the 3DMark Wild Life Unlimited was a fail at 1,828, beating out the Pixel 7 (1,755), but distantly behind the smartphone average (2,573).

The Pixel 7a is the poster child for my oft-repeated assertion that smartphones are more powerful than they need to be right now. It’s nowhere near the top of the heap in benchmark performance, but very few users will push past what it can deliver.

I was a little worried to see the 4,385mAh battery listed for the Pixel 7a after the Google Pixel 7 put up disappointing battery life with its 4,355mAh, but it seems Google cracked the code on Pixel battery life in the intervening months.

In our Laptop Mag battery test, the phone continuously surfs the web over a cellular connection with the display set at 150 nits. It lasted for 10 hours and 5 minutes. Now that’s not going to earn it a spot among our phones with the best battery life, but it’s a marathon finish compared to its predecessors. That was enough to narrowly outlast the smartphone average (9:53), and it left the iPhone SE 2022 (7:38) and the Google Pixel 7 (7:31) sucking wind as it powered through to the finish.

My typical day with a phone runs from 7:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. with a mix of Netflix or YouTube streaming on Wi-Fi for roughly two hours, YouTube Music in the background for a few hours, an hour of a podcast, web browsing, using social media, gaming for about 30 minutes, and capturing photos and videos. I haven’t fallen below 20% with this usage during my time with the phone so far and one thing to know about the Pixel battery life is that it gets better as it adjusts to your usage.

The Pixel 7a supports up to 18W fast charging, which is at this point just about the bare minimum to call fast charging, so it’s a good thing the battery life is solid. The big news for me though is the addition of wireless charging to a Pixel A series for the first time, I have a hard time living without it at this point.

To test the wired charging speeds we used our 20W charger, the Pixel 7a reached a 21% charge in 15 minutes and 43% charge in 30 minutes. That’s roughly even with the Pixel 7 (20%, 41%), but slower than the iPhone SE 2022 (31%, 61%), and the smartphone average (31%, 58%).

The Google Pixel 7a finally gets the camera makeover that we’ve been hoping for in the A series and it was worth the wait. The primary 64MP Quad PD Quad Bayer wide-angle camera with its f/1.89 aperture and 0.8µm wide pixels (1.6µm with pixel binning) produces some of the best low-light shots that I’ve seen in my testing so far. The ultra-wide gets an upgrade as well to a 13MP at f/2.2 and a 1.12µm pixel width. Don’t leave out the selfie camera either, front-facing photo fans will appreciate the new 13MP 95-degree ultrawide at f/2.2 with 1.12 µm pixel width.

While spring is still only reluctantly emerging in Wisconsin, the Pixel 7a’s main camera drew what color it could find out of my stroll through the neighborhood and around a local pond. The shots below show sharp detail in the grasses surrounding the pond and the fluffy bedding on the nest of a goose. Google has struck an excellent balance with the default settings here, not trending too warm or cool and accentuating the colors without falling into the hyperreal HDR look.

Check the final photo for a look at the stellar extreme low-light performance, the only lighting in the room was from my monitor roughly 5 feet away and I was standing between the Millenium Falcon and the monitor. The fact that it nailed the freshly painted white wall and kept every detail on the model in those conditions blew me away.

Turning to the ultra-wide, it’s color-matched well enough to the primary camera that I can’t see any differences in the sky, grasses, or water from one to the other in the set of shots that I captured during that same walk below. I would like to see Google improve the warping at the edges. Look at the shot of the goose on its nest and you’ll see that on the far right the tree branches appear a bit stretched. It’s less noticeable in landscape shots and you can of course crop the final photo to eliminate the problem, but Google’s software should be able to clean it up a bit better.

While the Pixel 7a doesn’t include a telephoto, I have to give Google credit for its 8x digital super zoom. Google kept it reasonable, not trying to push for 20x or anything outlandish and the 8x shots remain quite sharp. Some extra contrast creeps in, so you may need to do a little editing to get these shots exactly as you like them, but getting very usable 8x photos as you can see below will keep you from getting attacked by a nesting goose for getting too close.

I would mock my own selfie skills, but you’ll see the results anyway so there’s no point. With that said, the front-facing camera on the Pixel 7a does a solid job with what it has to work with. Using portrait mode it found the edges of my unkempt hair effectively and regrettably, that pallor is my current skin tone after a long winter indoors.

While photography is definitely the forte for the Pixel 7a, its video chops aren’t bad. 4K capture at up to 60fps can allow for smooth and sharp footage and Google continues to improve its video features with Cinematic Pan, Astrophotography timelapse, active video stabilization, and more. I’ll be offering more extensive coverage on the Pixel 7a’s photo and video features in the future to see just how far we can push those capabilities on this sub-$500 phone, but rest assured it is unequaled by anything near this price point.

The Google Pixel 7a runs Android 13 with a little bit of special Pixel sauce on top. While it’s not pure stock Android, it’s the closest any OEM comes to it and my favorite Android skin. Add in the Pixel exclusive (and timed Pixel exclusive) features and the consistent and reliable updates, and there’s a strong case to be made for Pixels as the best software experience on any Android phone.

This is all the more true since Google moved to its own Tensor chip that is customized for some of the AI features that Google has introduced in recent years. This includes numerous calling features like Direct My Call which lets you see pressable menu options when calling businesses without having to wait to hear them. Google’s Recorder app is a life-saver for journalists with automatically applied speaker labels that you can easily update. If you hate typing on your phone, Google’s enhanced Assistant Voice Typing lets you give your fingers a rest by just saying “Hey Google, type.”

Google promises five years of Pixel updates, which requires a little explanation. That’s five years of security updates that could also include Pixel feature drops and additional software updates. I would like to see Google move to four years of major Android updates, like Samsung and OnePlus, but considering how many of Android’s best features aren’t tied to the major OS updates, I don’t feel it’s a serious concern.

The Google Pixel 7a once again claims the title of the best budget phone and my pick for the best phone under $500. The OnePlus 11 is the only option below $1,000 that I think is worth considering over the Pixel 7a and that’s if gaming on your phone is one of your top uses.

Google has struck a near-perfect balance with this hardware and combined with the consistent Android updates, unique Pixel software features, and the growing Google hardware ecosystem it is going to be difficult for me to get away from recommending the Pixel 7a this year.

There are reasons to skip it. If you have to be in the Apple ecosystem, then by all means you need an iPhone. If you have to have a true optical telephoto zoom or high-end performance, then there are Android flagships that are a better choice for you. But for the majority of people, I think the Google Pixel 7a is likely to hold up as the best phone of 2023.

Google’s latest mid-range handset, the Pixel 7a, was an inevitability. What we didn’t expect, however, was for it to show up this early in the year. With the initial forecast for the Pixel 7a to make an appearance in the summer, akin to previous releases, its arrival was a welcome surprise. Except, of course, this early arrival makes a lot of sense, considering things didn’t work out quite as planned for 2022’s Pixel 6a. Terrific in almost every measure, it didn’t have an easy ride to the top of the mid-priced podium, launching a couple of weeks after the hugely anticipated Nothing Phone (1). For 2023, however, Google is hoping to get ahead of the game this year. We already know that the Nothing Phone (2) is on its way, but the Pixel 7a now has an early chance at (mostly) unimpeded fame and fortune – at least for a month or two.

Google Pixel 7a and charger – Unlocked Android 5G smartphone with wide-angle lens and 24-hour battery – Charcoal + Pixel Buds A-Series – Wireless earbuds – Charcoal (Amazon Exclusive)

The Pixel 7a is Google’s answer to those that want a flagship-class experience for less money. There are a few key differences, but broadly speaking the feature set is mostly the same as the rest of the range.

In fact, perusing the list of core specifications presents a tricky game of spot the difference. The Pixel 7a incorporates the same Google-made Tensor G2 chipset as the regular Pixel 7 and, while its display is slightly smaller (6.1in vs 6.3in), it’s still an OLED panel with a 90Hz refresh rate. It also comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage with no option to bump that up to 256GB.

The phones look identical, too, with the same horizontal camera bar on the rear. The only noticeable difference is the photographic hardware itself, with the Pixel 7a utilising a 64MP (f/1.9) main shooter and a 13MP (f/2.2) 120-degree ultrawide on the back, with another 13MP (f/2.2) selfie on the front.

The Pixel 7a is available to buy from 10 May and the price is right where it should be. There’s only one version available (8GB+128GB) and this costs just £449 – £150 less than the original launch price of the Pixel 7 seven months prior.

There has been a slight increase in price for 2023 compared to last year’s Pixel 6a, though. The 6a started at £399, which means we’re expected to pay an extra £50 (13%) for the Pixel 7a. That’s not a huge jump – we’ve certainly seen bigger increases from other companies – but it’s worth mentioning.

How does that price fare against the rest of the competition, then? The iPhone SE costs the same as the Pixel 7a at £449, though it only has a 4.7in display, single 12MP rear camera and a measly 64GB of storage. Its A15 Bionic processor trounces its opponents, however.

There’s also the Nothing Phone (1), which is still a great option even if it is due to be replaced in the coming months. It’s cheaper than the Pixel 7a at £399, its display has a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz and it has a unique light-up ‘Glyph Interface’ on the rear. The OnePlus Nord 2T is another worthwhile option and is the cheapest of all of these phones at £369.

If you’ve seen one Pixel, you’ve seen them all, and the Pixel 7a is no different. The horizontal rear camera bar, which stretches across the entire width of the phone, is back again, although it’s nowhere near as chunky as the unit on either the Google Pixel 7 or the Google Pixel 7 Pro.

At 73 x 152 x 9mm, it’s quite a bit smaller than the full-fat models, and it’s also a smidge lighter at 193g vs 197g and 212g. With smartphone sizes steadily ballooning with every new release, it’s refreshing to find a handset that’s heading in a more pocket-friendly direction. By contrast, my iPhone 13 Pro Max feels absolutely gigantic.

The phone can be picked up in either Charcoal (seen here), Snow, Sea or Coral colours. Google has gone as far as colour matching the horizontal camera bar with your chosen hue, and it’s also launching these new pastel shades across its  Pixel Buds A-Series earbuds – just in case you wanted to pick up a new, colour-coordinated pair while you’re at the checkout.

At the launch, Google was keen to mention that the 7a is “the most durable A series device ever built” and this is apparently thanks to a new mid-frame architecture, which the company says better protects the display in the event of accidental drops. It’s also IP67 rated for water and dust protection, just like before.

The Pixel 7a’s lineup of buttons and ports can all be found in sensible places, with the power button and volume rocker on the right-hand edge and the nanoSIM slot located on the opposite side. The 18W USB-C port is at the bottom, and this sits between a pair of speaker grilles – although one of these exists solely for the purposes of cosmetic symmetry.

A brand-new addition for this year is the return of face unlocking. This was a feature that was missing from Pixel phones for a number of years, so it’s great to see it return alongside the usual under-screen fingerprint and PIN unlock methods.

The Pixel 7a’s 6.1in Full HD resolution (2,400 x 1,080) display is an OLED panel with a 90Hz refresh rate which can also be toggled to 60Hz if you prefer. Google says that peak brightness is 25% higher than last year’s Pixel 6a, although this doesn’t quite align with our testing, with the 7a achieving roughly the same levels of luminance. I recorded 505cd/m2 with auto-brightness off, 480cd/m2 with auto brightness on and 859cd/m2 in HDR playback.

Colour performance, on the other hand, is exquisite. There are two display modes on offer this year – Natural and Adaptive – with the former being the most colour accurate of the two. In this mode, the Pixel 7a’s display covered 93% of the sRGB colour gamut, with a total volume of 94% and an average Delta E of 0.86 – anything less than one here is essentially perfect.

As for the Pixel 7a’s internal componentry, we’re getting Google’s Tensor G2 chipset this year. This is a 5nm octa-core part, with a clock speed of 2.85GHz and is the same processor found inside the rest of this year’s Pixels. It also has the same 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage but lacks the Pixel 7’s 256GB option.

There’s not much that separates the performance of the Pixel 6a and 7a in our benchmarks, but there’s still a lot to like here. Speeds are reasonably fast, achieving both 1,061 and 3,309 in the Geekbench 5 single- and multi-core tests, outperforming the Nothing Phone (1) by a comfortable distance.

The Pixel 7a’s bump in refresh rate from 60Hz up to 90Hz opens the door for higher frame rates in gaming apps. The Tensor G2 is quite powerful in this regard, too, with the Pixel 7a reaching 62fps in the GFXBench Car Chase test, compared to 50fps last year. Run the Manhattan 3 benchmark, which is a slightly older, less graphically demanding test, and you get a perfect 90fps.

What’s even better is the Pixel 7a’s battery life. This is an area where the Pixel 7a is hugely improved on last year’s model. It scored 23hrs 49mins in our looping video benchmark, which is three hours longer than what the Pixel 6a achieved last year. It’s also the longest-lasting phone in its price bracket that we’ve tested and by a comfortable margin, too.

A key part of the Pixel’s appeal is its software. They’re usually the first phones to receive core Android updates – Android 14 is on the horizon – and they’re as close to “stock” Android as it possible to get.

The Pixel 7a is no different, launching with Android 13 and layered with Google’s ‘Material You’ interface tweaks. Like last year, this gives you granular control over how themes and widgets look on your phone and matches the UI with your chosen wallpaper style.

The Pixel 7a gets a handful of new Google Assistant features, too. Call assist options that were previously limited to the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro can be found here, including Clear Calling wind noise reduction and call screening, where your phone handles robocalls for you. However, the latter is only available in the US at the time of writing.

Other AI-based features include an automatic voice message transcription option in the Messages app as well as hands-free assistant-based voice typing.

Where the Pixel 7a diverts course from the rest of the range is in its camera hardware, although it’s worth mentioning that its software and shooting capabilities remain exactly the same as the rest of the range.

This year, the Pixel 7a is equipped with a 64MP main camera on the rear, which is located next to a secondary 13MP 120-degree ultrawide. On the front, a single 13MP camera handles the phone’s selfie-snapping duties and this is embedded in the top centre of the screen in a small hole punch notch.

Pixel enthusiasts may have spotted that all these cameras have a higher resolution than those on the pricier Pixel 7. Indeed, the total number of megapixels is higher across the board on the 7a, with the biggest difference being the main lens at 64MP vs 50MP. On paper, this might make you question why you would bother to spend the extra £150.

Regardless, it punches well above its price and matched its siblings in my camera tests, capturing spectacular shots in a wide range of lighting conditions and environments. Images are highly detailed and captured with a pleasingly rich colour palette.

Google says that Night Sight capture is 2x faster than before and it really shows. Low-light images are captured almost instantaneously and there’s less time spent in the back-end processing stage after you snap the picture.

I did encounter one bug during my tests, however, where the Pixel 7a refused to capture an image, even when pressing the on-screen shutter button multiple times. Thankfully, this only happened once and was rectified by simply closing and re-opening the app.

There’s no telephoto camera but the Pixel 7a is capable of digitally zooming up to 8x courtesy of what Google calls “Super Res Zoom”. This merely crops the image but it also applies some of Google’s back-end trickery to clean up the image and the result look surprisingly good.

The phone’s ultrawide sensor isn’t quite as impressive as the main unit but there’s still plenty to like here. You lose a bit of detail in squeezing more stuff into the frame but the colours are accurately represented and the image processing does a great job at removing optical distortion in the corners of the picture.

The Pixel 7a gets a handful of other software-based camera features as well. The excellent Photo Unblur mode has finally trickled down to Google’s mid-priced Pixel, alongside Magic Eraser – to remove unwanted people or objects simply tap or draw a circle around those parts of the image – while Real Tone produces accurate skin tones in portrait mode.

In fact, it’s one of the best smartphones, full stop, for capturing portrait images. Subject definition is nice and crisp, with well-judged tonality and facial features as well as a clear separation of the blurred background. And, finally, video recording is pretty good with the ability to shoot 4K resolution clips at 60fps, fully stabilised. Footage was nicely detailed and was largely rock-steady, even during rapid panning.

On the surface, the Pixel 7a’s changes are few and far between but dig a little deeper and you’ll discover a wide range of improvements across the board, from battery life to cameras to software.

All told, the Pixel 7a is one of the most well-rounded mid-priced handsets I’ve put to the test in a number of years and is a worthy recipient of our Best Buy award.

Text: Google's latest mid-range Pixel handset, the Google Pixel 7a, was finally unveiled at Google IO 2023, after weeks of build-up which saw almost all of the phone's specs leaked ahead of time.

We were able to get our hands on the new device – which is positioned as the successor to the Google Pixel 6a – prior to the event itself, so head over to our full Google Pixel 7a review for our thoughts on whether Google's latest Pixel offering lives up to the hype of being one of the best cheap phones of 2023.

In this guide, we'll run you through all the key Google Pixel 7a specs – from the phone's camera setup and battery life credentials to its processor and display technology.

* What is it? An affordable alternative to the Pixel 7

* When is it out? May 10

* How much will it cost? $499 / £449 / AU$749

The Google Pixel 7a was officially unveiled at Google I/O 2023 on May 10, with the phone going on sale for $499 / £449 / AU$749 at the time of announcement. Head over to our Google Pixel 7a deals page for the best offers live now.

For comparison, the Pixel 6a retailed for $449 / £399 / AU$749 at launch, so Google opted to bump up the 7a's price in the US and UK. That said, the new phone does offer a suite of improvements over its predecessor, as you'll see below.

The Google Pixel 7a is available in four colors – Charcoal, Snow, Sea and Coral (though the latter is only available from Google directly) – and just one storage option: 128GB.

Check out the phone’s full specs below:

On the design front, the Google Pixel 7a shares obvious DNA with the other two Pixel 7 phones – it’s got a smooth back, a metal frame and a camera bar – and this latest addition to the Pixel family is supposedly Google's most durable A-Series phone yet. Its display features Corning Gorilla Glass, and the phone has been designed using a host of recycled materials including aluminum, glass and plastic.

The Google Pixel 7a packs a 6.1-inch OLED screen with a refresh rate of up to 90Hz – which, incidentally, is a superior refresh rate to the vanilla iPhone 14 – and the device uses Google's Tensor G2 chip under the hood.

Coupled with 8GB of RAM, that processor should allow the Google Pixel 7a to meet the demands of streaming, swiping, snapping and mobile gaming with ease – perhaps even as well as the standard Google Pixel 7, which uses the same chipset.

When it comes to cameras, the Google Pixel 7a features a dual rear camera set-up that comprises a 64MP main lens – the largest ever included on an A-Series device – and a 13MP ultra-wide lens. Super Res Zoom will allow for clearer close-up portraits from far away, and the Pixel 7a also features Long Exposure (another first for the A-Series). On the front is a 13MP camera that’s capable of Face Unlock – an upgrade over the Pixel 6a’s 8MP selfie snapper.

Google says the phone’s 4,385mAh battery will yield more than 24 hours of use (or 72 hours if you turn on Extreme Battery Saver mode), and the Pixel 7a supposedly learns your favorite apps so it doesn't waste power on ones that you rarely use. The device supports 18W fast charging and 7.5W wireless charging on any Qi-certified accessories, too.

Text: The Pixel 7a might be the best Pixel Google has ever built. The price-to-performance ratio is off the charts good and the camera is better than ever thanks to a huge camera hardware upgrade. Unless you need better battery life or like to zoom beyond 5x, there's no reason to spend your $500 elsewhere.

Last year, Google redefined what a Pixel A series device looked and felt like. The Pixel 6a was gorgeous and featured the same great Tensor processor as the more expensive Pixel 6 series, but it had to cut back a few things to ensure it met the $450 price tag.

This year, the Pixel 7a increases the price by $50 but addresses almost all the shortcomings of last year's model. It's got a 90Hz display, wireless charging support, a better fingerprint sensor, a faster processor with more features, and the biggest camera hardware upgrade ever for a Pixel A-series phone.

It's the new king of best cheap Android phones and it's hard to argue with any reason to spend more than $500 on a new phone this year — and a great Pixel 7a deal might make it even less — but it also isn't without at least one notable negative point.

During the review period, I ran into a few strange bugs with the front-facing camera that caused a lot of power drain. I've reported the bug to Google but, until then, using Face Unlock or Face Detect for Auto-Rotate features causes an inordinate power drain. Based on our lab tests and experience after disabling these features, though, the battery should be enough to get most people through more than a full day.

The Google Pixel 7a is available to order from Google and all of your favorite electronics stores, as well as a smattering of carriers for $499 USD / $599 CAD. The Pixel 7a is available in a total of 17 countries including:

In the tiny box, you'll find the Pixel 7a alongside a USB-C to USB-C cable, a USB-A to USB-C adapter, a SIM tray eject tool, and the usual set of pamphlets. The Pixel 7a does not include a charger but supports up to 18W USB-PD charging speeds and 5W Qi wireless charging.

As usual, there's a slew of great Pixel 7a cases to get — you'll definitely want one since this phone is so slippery — and the best Pixel 7a screen protectors will keep that screen looking brand new for the life of the phone.

If you thought the picture above was of the more expensive Google Pixel 7, you probably wouldn't be alone. Everything about the Pixel 7a looks nearly identical to its more expensive counterpart down to the metal camera bar on the back and the in-display fingerprint sensor on the front.

And while it still uses the same style plastic back as the Pixel 6a did last year, the metal frame and camera bar housing did enough to convince me that this year's model felt more solid and better built than last year's. Not that I had much of an issue with the 6a's build quality at all but these little extras go a long way to making a cheaper phone feel more premium.

If I had to make one complaint about the redesigned build, it's that the plastic back is an absolute dust and fingerprint magnet. The amount of time I had to spend cleaning off the phone and then subsequently erasing smudges and dust specks in Photoshop felt almost unreal.

This thing will find any trace of dust anywhere on the planet and suck it right to its casing. Thankfully, the cases from Google will make you forget all about how the phone looks on its own and likely never want to go back to using the phone naked again.

The incredibly bright and vibrant one you see in the photos is Google's coral color which ranges between a salmon or azalea color in sunlight to an almost traffic cone orange in some types of fluorescent light. It's not too dissimilar from the Pixel 4's "Oh So Orange" colorway except that it completely surrounds the phone with lovely soft, grippy padding.

And trust me when I say you're probably going to drop this phone if you try to use it naked. Google swapped the slightly grippier side rails of the 6a to a smoother, duller metal that's as slippery as it gets. The edges of the display and corners of the camera bar are also very flat and nearly sharp to the touch, so a case helps round those out substantially.

But all the other pieces of the puzzle are chef's kiss good. Google's haptics are the best in the business and it's not even remotely close. The in-display fingerprint sensor is actually good and really, truly works. That's quite the opposite of the 6 series and, at least for me, much, much better than any in-display ultrasonic sensor Samsung uses on its phones.

Even the display has improved from one generation to the next. At nearly 200 nits brighter — according to testing done by Android Central's parent company, Future — this AMOLED display is incredibly easy to see outdoors and gets nice and dim in the dark.

Oh, and let's not forget the fact that Google addressed one of the biggest issues we had with the Pixel 6a: the display refresh rate. At 90Hz, the Pixel 7a's display is buttery smooth and feels great all around, even if the "Smooth Display" option isn't enabled out of the box.

Google is using an AMOLED display with PWM dimming which, unfortunately, makes me quite sick when using auto brightness. Unfortunately for me — and anyone else who suffers from PWM sensitivity — most modern AMOLED-powered phones use a relatively low-frequency PWM dimming frequency.

This means the display controls the "brightness" by flashing itself on and off several times per second. Most people don't perceive this flashing and aren't affected but folks who do — like myself — develop headaches and nausea when this happens.

On the bright side, this display seems to disable PWM dimming when the brightness is at 100%. It's not the best solution in the world but it means I can still use the Pixel 7a without feeling awful.

As you might expect, the Google Pixel 7a got the upgraded Tensor G2 processor from the Pixel 7 series — the same processor that powers the upcoming Google Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet, in fact. As we saw with the Pixel 7, performance is great for everyday tasks and apps but it's not as fast for gaming as some of the top-end Qualcomm processors.

Of course, this isn't being sold as a top-end phone, so let's compare it to the Pixel 6a to see the improvement — and the Galaxy A54 5G to see what it's currently up against.

On the benchmark side of things, the Pixel 7a is roughly 10% faster than the Pixel 6a in Geekbench tests while most other benchmarks — 3DMark, CrossMark, Web XPRT — show nearly identical performance between the two generations. Things really improved in Basemark with the Pixel 7a showing a 46% improvement over the 6a.

The Pixel 7a far outperformed the Galaxy A54 5G in every benchmark that Future Labs ran. Future is Android Central's parent company and runs standardized lab tests on every device we review.

More specifically, the Pixel 7a was 23% faster than the Galaxy A54 5G in Geekbench 6, 31% faster in CrossMark, more than twice as fast in 3DMark, and an unbelievable 300% faster in Basemark's Vulkan tests.

In short, if performance is your top priority and you don't want to spend more than $500 on a phone, the Pixel 7a is the phone to get.

Remember that this chip is technically a flagship-tier chipset and you're almost assuredly not going to see another company use this grade of chip on a mid-range phone.

Titles like Genshin Impact — one of the best Android games and, by far, one of the most beautiful — can be played on the highest settings but don't expect 60FPS from this chip. You'll want to dial the settings back a bit for that.

Games like Fortnite didn't yet officially support the 7a during my testing so it was limited to 30FPS. I'll have to test that later and update this review with the results, but, I expect nothing short of great performance.

With that boost in performance — plus the jump to a 90Hz display — comes a hit to battery life. In short, the battery life on the Pixel 7a has been anything but great for me but, thankfully, I'm pretty sure it's because of a software bug and not some underlying hardware issue.

From what I can tell, my problems were mostly solved by turning off Face Unlock and Face Detection during auto-rotate features. I've submitted a bug report to Google so that these can be fixed but, for the time being, I'd advise not using these features if you want all-day battery life.

Out of the box, the Pixel 7a's display runs at 60Hz, most likely in an effort to get most people the best battery life. You can opt for 90Hz by jumping into display options and selecting "smooth display" to enable 90Hz. In my testing, however, this didn't affect battery life in any meaningful way.

Theoretically, the Pixel 7a has substantially better battery life than the 6a despite having a slightly smaller battery. Future Labs shows over 3 hours better battery life than the 6a which is an incredible efficiency improvement by any measure, although that metric was achieved by keeping the display at 60Hz.

Google packed Qi wireless charging into the 7a — a feature that was missing from the 6a — although it's only 5W so it's best for keeping your battery from draining rather than power-charging it in short order.

The 7a also only supports up to 18W wired charging via a USB C charger which is fine enough but not considered "fast" these days. You'll find a 20W charger will get to 43% in half an hour. It'll take well over an hour and a half to charge to full.

Like any Pixel phone, the Pixel 7a ships with the latest version of Android and is guaranteed to see support for the next 5 years. Pixel owners can expect regular Pixel Feature Drops that add new features and fun things every few months, and you can always be the first to test out the latest version of Android months before any other phone.

With Tensor G2, Google upped the ante with on-device machine learning and includes exclusive features like Photo Unblur and Call Screening, two features that are truly difficult to live without once you get used to using them.

Plus, the instant voice-to-text on GBoard using Tensor is almost addictive to use. It's amazing how much faster and more accurate Google's voice transcription is, and the processor can even do real-time translation of foreign languages on the off chance you find yourself needing the feature on vacation.

Not only that, but Google is including VPN by Google One for free for all Pixel 7a users regardless if they are Google One subscribers. This important service helps mask your internet traffic by encrypting it when you're on a public Wi-Fi hotspot, ensuring that would-be hackers can't steal your data.

Check this page to make sure your country is eligible for VPN by Google One.

The At a Glance widget is constantly seeing improvements and additions. My favorite recent one is the ability to stop an alarm that's going off on any Nest Hub display or speaker in your home via the widget on your phone's home screen.

Really just beautiful product integration by Google Teams. I can't tell you how many cups of tea this has saved me from over-steeping when I go downstairs, start working, and forget I even set a timer to begin with.

Google also promises 5 years of Pixel Updates with the phone, matching the best update policies available on Android.

And while I love most of Google's Pixel UI in Android, the one thing that still irks me is the nearly useless Overview UI. Swiping left and right on the gesture navigation bar on the bottom is great but sometimes I want to navigate back a little further than the most recent apps.

Companies like Samsung offer apps like Good Lock to allow users to customize the UI the way they'd like but Google doesn't offer anything similar. What you're stuck with is this useless "multitasking" UI — pictured above — that only shows one app at a time.

How am I supposed to quickly navigate between several apps if I have to scroll through giant thumbnails of each one? It's just not efficient or effective and we've been dealing with this awful UI since Android 9 Pie. Google, please, please rethink this one.

What would a Pixel review be without gushing about how good the camera is? Not a Pixel review, that's for sure.

As is the case with basically every Pixel phone in existence, you're going to be hard-pressed to find any other phone in this price range that takes pictures this good. That's even more the case this year as Google has upgraded the camera sensors on the Pixel 7a for the first time in the history of Pixel A-series phones.

That tired old 12MP sensor has been swapped out for a shiny new 64MP one and boy, oh boy has it ever made a huge difference. Last year, I was impressed with the fact that the Pixel 6a tended to take as good of — or sometimes better — pictures than the Pixel 6 despite having a much lower resolution sensor.

Google upped its game with the Pixel 7 and, true to expectations, the 7a is yet another upgrade. In my testing, the Pixel 7's camera still came ever so slightly ahead but I really had to nitpick to tell the difference. I'm comfortable with saying that the Pixel 7a takes just as good of photos as the Pixel 7 in most situations and that even includes low light.

Thanks to the newer Tensor G2 that powers the phone, the Pixel 7a takes night shots twice as fast as the Pixel 6a. Combine that with the new sensor and you have shots that look notably better in every single measurement, all while taking half as long to capture the shot.

It's quite literally everything I could have asked for in a camera upgrade from Google and surpassed my expectations in almost every way.

In most situations, the Pixel 7a blows away the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G's camera quality. From daytime to nighttime, Google continuously wins in detail and exposure in any kind of shot.

It's clear the company has worked to improve its algorithm to ensure that a higher-megapixel camera sensor does perform as inconsistently as it did when the Pixel 6 debuted.

Zoom detail was a bit disappointing but, given the lack of a telephoto lens, that shouldn't be too surprising. But the only reasons I held any kind of elevated expectations for zoom detail were twofold.

One, this is a higher-resolution sensor. I don't think I have to explain my thoughts there. Two, Google spent quite a bit of space in the review literature talking about Super Res Zoom and how good it was.

If I'm being fair, it's better than what's offered on the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G but only marginally and it's very situationally dependent. I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to claim this is heads and tails better, by any means.

I only had two real problems with the Pixel 7a's camera quality. First, was with the white balance. In several situations, the 7a's camera tended to hedge on the green side of things for white balance. Any time something brown or black was prominently in the frame — like the inside of a barbeque grill or a wooden table — the phone tended to make the photo a little too green for its own good.

Second, Google still seems to struggle with nailing the cut-outs in portrait mode. Samsung does this a lot better and it feels a bit strange given how good Google's AI-powered people identification is in Google Photos. It'll certainly give you great shots every now and then but it's far too inconsistent for my liking.

And while nearly everything in the camera app is identical to the pricier Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, there's still no option to use the Motion mode from those phones. Last year, Google said the smaller 12MP sensor was the reason they didn't include Motion mode but, this year, that's clearly not the case.

Of course, Google has to have reasons to shift customers to a more expensive model if they want a certain feature. The Pixel 7a's sensor might be higher-resolution than the 50MP main sensor on the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro but it's actually a physically smaller sensor.

This doesn't seem to have much of a negative effect on real-world performance but a physically larger sensor can allow the phone to capture more detail and have a more pleasing bokeh.

Video recording was also improved generation-to-generation, with the front-facing camera gaining the ability to record in 4K quality. Overall, the video quality of this phone is better than what Samsung offers on the Galaxy A54 5G, particularly when it comes to more accurate white balance.

The Samsung Galaxy A54 5G is the nearest competitor to the Pixel 7a and it comes in at $50 cheaper. While you'll gain a plethora of Samsung features and excellent compatibility with Samsung's wider ecosystem, the A54 5G has a worse camera and much worse overall performance. On the bright side, the phone offers better battery life than what I experienced with the Pixel 7a.

If you're still looking for a great Pixel phone and don't like the new $500 price point of the 7a, you could always opt for a Pixel 6a. Great Pixel 6a deals will get you the phone for almost half the cost of a new 7a and you'll still get great Pixel features from the first-generation Tensor processor, the same great 12MP camera people have loved for years on older Pixel phones and a gorgeous design that fits the Pixel 6 line.

You should buy this if:

* You want the best performance on a mid-range budget.

* You want the best cameras on a mid-range budget.

* You want a phone that'll be supported for the next 5 years.

You shouldn't buy this if:

* You must have a camera telephoto lens.

It's hard to argue with Google's latest A-series Pixel. It completely eliminates the need for the smaller Pixel 7 as you'll find the camera is just as good and the battery life is identical. While it's got a slightly cheaper-feeling plastic back, you're probably going to keep it in a case, anyway.

Google upgraded the camera over the Pixel 6a, representing the biggest camera upgrade — both hardware and in quality — of any A-series phone. Really, unless you need to regularly zoom in more than 5x, there's no reason to even spend the extra money to get the Pixel 7 Pro, either.

The price-to-performance ratio of the 7a is without parallel and the 7a represents the absolute best deal you'll find in the Android world right now. I just wish the battery life were a little bit better because, if that were the case, this would be the perfect phone for the price.

Softtitle: vs Pixel 7 and Pixel 6a!

Text: I enjoy this time of the year. It’s when the big tech companies finally start to show us what they’ve been working on.

Google, as always, has beaten Apple to it in the smartphone stakes, announcing both the Pixel Fold and the Pixel 7a. You can expect my full review of the former as soon as I get my hands on it, but I’ve had my mitts on the Pixel 7a for the last week.

Is Google’s latest budget smartphone worth the £50 price hike over the Pixel 6a? And how does it stack up against the Pixel 7? Is it all a bit too close for comfort?

The Pixel 7a costs £449, which is £50 more expensive than its predecessor. However, for that, you get quite a phone – at least on paper.

The 7a packs in the latest Google Tensor G2 chip, 8GB of RAM, a 6.1-inch display, and a 64MP main camera system. There’s just one storage option on the table, which is 128GB, but there are some tasty upgrades including a 90Hz refresh rate (that should keep the critics at bay, finally), a more premium design, and wireless charging.

At first glance and when placed side-by-side with the Pixel 6a, the Pixel 7a looks like a very tempting upgrade. But how does that spec sheet manifest itself when you put Google’s latest budget device to use in everyday life?

As noted, the Pixel 7a is a deceiving device when it comes to design, fit, and finish. It looks and feels far more premium than its relatively modest price tag suggests it should.

I’m a fan. As much as I liked the Pixel 6a’s relatively understated design, it didn’t feel particularly special. The Pixel 7a is a handsome device by comparison and provides that immediate buyer satisfaction; it feels like you’re getting a lot for your money as soon as you unearth it from its box.

The only downside is how magnetic the rear plastic back is when it comes to dust, smudges, and fingerprints. It’s a YouTuber tech reviewer’s worst nightmare and as lovely as that faux glass finish might look, it gets grubby way too quickly. To counter this, we do at least have a camera housing that doesn’t appear to scratch quite as easily as the one on the Pixel 7 Pro.

Moving onto the display, and it’s a lovely thing. Anyone upset about the lack of a high refresh rate screen on previous ‘a’ series Pixels should now be satisfied with this 90Hz panel, and it’s plenty sharp and bright enough, to boot. The fact we now get both a fingerprint reader and face unlock means that nothing is left on the table.

If you know me, you know that I don’t bother with long-winded, in-depth benchmarking on smartphones. I don’t play games on them either, so my assessment of the Pixel 7a performance is typically ‘everyday user’.

For that use case (which is, I suspect, how the vast majority of people will put this phone to use) it absolutely ‘slaps’, as the kids say. The combination of that speedy Tensor G2 chip and the fact that this is the purest version of Android you’ll find on any smartphone makes the Pixel 7a a brilliant performer.

The Pixel 7a happily continues the trend of providing flagship performance for a fraction of the cost. It never lags, stutters or warms your thigh due to overexertion.

The battery life isn’t quite flagship, mind. It’ll get you beyond a day, but that’s pushing it; you’ll find yourself reaching for a charger faster than you would with the Pixel 7 or Pixel 7 Pro. Standby time is impressive, though, so if you’re a light user, this could take you into nearly two-day-battery territory. The inclusion of wireless charging is also very welcome, even if it is rather slow.

I’m a huge Pixel camera fan. There’s just something about the way these devices process images that sits very nicely with me. They’re contrasty, moody, and full of character; I can spot a Pixel photo a mile off.

I’d argue that Pixels are fast becoming one of the few smartphones with a recognisable photo signature. Everything else seems to be heading in the same direction in terms of photo processing.

The Pixel 7a’s 64MP camera system produces some wonderful images. I’ll let you be the judge of them because this is such a subjective topic, but for me, it’s up there with the best of them.

The video performance on the Pixel 7a isn’t up there with the iPhone (nothing is) but it’s great for the asking price. It produces a decent 4K image with admirable dynamic range – you can’t ask for much more at this level, and I doubt users of the ‘a’ series Pixels do anything more than capture life’s moments. The stabilisation is a matter of taste, though – it’s very fake gimbal-like in the way it shifts robotically as you pan, but it’s workable.

If you’ve had your eye on the Pixel 6a for a while, the good news is that you’ll probably pick up a serious bargain now its successor has arrived.

That said, there are quite a few differences between the two phones. The 7a features the latest generation of Google’s Tensor chip, a couple more gigabytes of RAM, wireless charging, face unlock, and a significantly improved camera system.

For me, the fact that the Pixel 7a is a generation ahead and offers those genuinely beneficial extras makes the £50 uplift in price worth it. But if you’re not that fussed about those additions and just want an awesome low-cost phone with the best Android experience, the Pixel 6a arguably cannot be beaten at its price point (while you can still buy it, of course!).

The increased price brings the budget Pixel 7a fascinatingly close to the mid-range Pixel 7. There’s now just a £150 price difference between the two, which is small enough to raise several questions.

Eyebrows will raise further when I reveal that both devices share the same chip, identical memory, and a 90Hz display.

There are some differences, though. The Pixel 7 offers two storage options – 128GB and 256GB, whereas you’re stuck with the former on the Pixel 7a. The Pixel 7 display is marginally bigger, too (6.3 inches versus 6.1 inches), and it has slightly better water and dust resistance.

While both phones have wireless charging, the Pixel 7 features a speedier 20W compared to the 7.5W charging on the Pixel 7a. As noted, you’ll get longer from a full charge on the Pixel 7, too (although not by much).

However, one of the biggest differences on paper is the camera system. The Pixel 7a has a different and larger sensor than the Pixel 7 (64MP versus 50MP), although the latter has bigger pixels and a slightly larger aperture for better light capture. In reality, though, there’s very little between them unless you continually A/B the same photo. No one does that apart from reviewers.

The choice between the Pixel 7a and the Pixel 7 is pretty simple. If you want more storage, you get the Pixel 7. If a slightly more premium build quality and a marginally bigger display – along with faster wireless charging and better water resistance – matters, you get the Pixel 7.

If none of that stuff bothers you, just get the Pixel 7a.

The Pixel ‘a’ series continues to impress. The price hike will bother some, but I still think it’s very tricky to find anything close to what the Pixel 7a offers at this level – particularly given the unfettered Android experience that’s baked into Google’s device.

It feels as though Google has added just enough to the Pixel 7a to make the 6a feel like yesterday’s news for all but the most budget-conscious buyer. The comparison with the Pixel 7 is almost too close for comfort, but £150 is still a fair chunk of cash that can be spent on something else if you’re happy to forgo the relatively minor upgrades on offer from Google’s mid-range smartphone.

I won’t lie – I was worried about the Pixel 7a. Would it live up to its predecessor’s budget brilliance while asking for more investment from its users? The answer is a resounding “yes”.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a review: The same performance as Google's flagship phones at a remarkable value
Publisher: Business Insider

Since Google first released its Pixel A-series in 2019, phone buyers looking for the best bang for their buck have had few reasons to look elsewhere, as Google's mid-range phones have consistently outdone the competition with their strong performance and stellar camera quality.

While the Pixel 7a represents an incremental performance upgrade over last year's fantastic Pixel 6a, Google has added premium features to its latest mid-ranger, like wireless charging and a display with a higher refresh rate.

As a result, though it starts at $500, the Pixel 7a is hardly a mid-range phone. It's essentially a smaller version of the $600 flagship Pixel 7, and in some ways, the Pixel 7 Pro, too, offering the same high-end performance at a more affordable price.

The Pixel 7a's design is immediately recognizable as a Google phone with its sharp corners and raised camera bar on the back, and you could easily mistaken it for the premium Pixel 7.

But there are some telltale signs that the Pixel 7a lacks premium qualities. For one, it's rather thick at 0.35 inches. The black borders around the display are also on the thick side.

The Pixel 7a's frame is made of metal, but its back is plastic. It's a high-quality plastic that looks like clear glass, and it's hard to tell the difference by looking at it. At 6.8 ounces, the Pixel 7a is rather heavy for a phone with a 6.1-inch screen. It's perfectly manageable, but somewhat disappointing consider the Pixel 6a weighs around 6.3 ounces.

For a mid-range phone in 2023, the Pixel 7a's 1080p OLED display running at a 90Hz refresh rate is typical. It offers the same excellent experience as the Pixel 7's 6.3-inch display, which also has a 90Hz refresh rate. The screen is bright, its colors are rich, and its contrast is superb thanks to the OLED panel.

There are some phones in the mid-range category that use smoother 120Hz displays. However, those phones can also deliver stuttered performance as a result, as their underpowered processors aren't up to the task of powering a 120Hz display perfectly smoothly like a premium phone can. The Pixel 7a's 90Hz refresh rate provides a consistently smooth experience, and it's much better than the typical 60Hz display used in many mid-range phones.

The Pixel 7a runs on the same Google Tensor G2 processor that's found in the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. Because of that, the Pixel 7a feels just as snappy as the Pixel 7 when running basic apps, like Chrome and Instagram. It also means that the Pixel 7a should last as long as Google's flagship phones, including the $900 Pixel 7 Pro.

The Pixel 7a scored slightly lower than the Pixel 7 overall in our benchmarking tests using the Geekbench 6 and 3DMark Wild Life apps, meaning the Pixel 7a isn't quite as powerful as the Pixel 7 on paper. That was surprising to find considering both phones run on the same processor. Still the day-to-day experience is identical.

The Pixel 7a's 64MP main camera and 13MP ultrawide camera are upgraded from the Pixel 6a's 12MP cameras, but in day-to-day shooting, both phones capture beautiful photos with Google's signature look that includes deep contrast, plenty of detail, and natural, rich color.

As is the case with all of Google's phones, some photos taken by the Pixel 7a can appear darker, and it's often because Pixel phones avoid over-brightening for the sake of making them artificially pleasing. In return, you're usually rewarded with rich colors and depth of detail.

The Pixel 7a's photo can also look dark to avoid any risk of overexposure. In the example below, the Pixel 7a is able to capture all the details in the cat's bright white fur while some other mid-rangers can brighten the photo too much and void those brighter details.

Like the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, the Pixel 7a suffers from occasionally blurry results when taking photos of moving subjects, like pets or my toddler — something I very rarely experience with Apple's iPhone 14 lineup.

The Pixel 7a doesn't have a dedicated zoom lens, a feature that's reserved for the Pixel 7 Pro. Instead, Google's Super Res Zoom uses software to digitally get closer, while delivering some usable shots — something difficult to achieve for digital zoom.

The Pixel 7a ended our battery stress test with a 58% charge remaining, which is on par with and even outperformed some more expensive phones with 6.1-inch screens. To compare, the premium, 6.1-inch iPhone 14 Pro had the same result, and the 6.1-inch Samsung Galaxy S23 had 56% remaining. The 6.3-inch Pixel 7, for contrast, ended the battery gauntlet with 60% remaining.

In a nutshell, it means the Pixel 7a's battery life is adequate, and it won't change a typical daily charging habit.

Our battery test puts all the phones we test through five runs of the Geekbench 6 app, two runs of the intensive 3DMark Wild Life Stress Test, two hours of video streaming, and one hour of music streaming while connected to Bluetooth headphones.

The Pixel 7a supports up to 18W fast charging. It's not as fast as the 25W or greater charging speeds on premium phones, but it gets the job done.

For wireless charging, the Pixel 7a supports up to 7.5W charging speeds, which is slow but acceptable.

The Pixel 7a comes in two variants. There's a $500 unlocked model you can buy from Google, third-party retailers, AT&T, and T-Mobile, which supports "sub6" 5G networks that perform essentially the same as the incumbent LTE networks.

Then, there's a Verizon-exclusive Pixel 7a that costs $550 and supports Verizon's "mmWave" 5G networks, which offer significantly faster speeds where such coverage is available.

Verizon's mmWave 5G network is not yet widespread, however, and it's quite limited compared to its sub6 5G network — you could potentially go through an entire day without ever connecting to the carrier's faster mmWave 5G network. With that in mind, Verizon subscribers don't necessarily need to buy the mmWave 5G model from Verizon, as you could buy an unlocked model that supports sub6 5G networks.

That said, Verizon is constantly expanding its mmWave 5G networks. The rollout is slow, but if you buy the mmWave 5G model of the Pixel 7a from Verizon, for just $50 more, you'll have a device that's ready to support its mmWave 5G network.

The Pixel 7a should be at the very top of your list if you're looking to spend around $500 on a phone.

It's essentially a more affordable version of Google's flagship phones, the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, offering the same Google Tensor 2 processor as both models and the same smooth, 90Hz display as the Pixel 7.

Of course, for its price, the Pixel 7a does come with some trade-offs. Its thick casing and plastic back distinguish it from the thinner, more premium builds of the Pixel 7 phones, which are made of glass and metal. The 7a's 6.8-ounce weight is also a bit cumbersome for its 6.1-inch screen size.

If you're looking for the ultimate value for a phone in 2023, however, Google is keeping the Pixel 6a available as an option for $350, which is an astonishingly good deal for its performance and camera quality, though it lacks the 7a's wireless charging and high-end processor.

Google Pixel 7a: Everything you need to know

Google has just revealed its latest budget-focused smartphone, the Google Pixel 7a, and it’s a doozy of an update.

Not only does the Google 7a finally make the jump from 60Hz to a 90Hz like the regular Pixel 7, but huge camera upgrades with a sensor 72% larger than that of the Pixel 6a should see significant gains in the camera department, and there’s also the flagship Tensor G2 chipset on offer.

However, there’s a catch – the Pixel 7a is the most expensive Pixel ‘a’ phone to date, starting at £449/$499. Is it still worth that much or are there better mid-range phones available? Here’s everything you need to know about the Pixel 7a, from release date and pricing to key features and specs.

The Google Pixel 7a is available to pre-order right now, with the smartphone shipping from tomorrow, 11 May 2023.

The Google Pixel 7a is the most expensive a-series smartphone yet, coming in at £449/$499, representing a price hike of £50/$100 compared to the Google Pixel 6a.

However, we think the Pixel 7a is still great value even with a slight price increase, especially with the upgraded hardware on offer from this year’s model that brings it very close to the £599/$599 Pixel 7.

If you’re interested, you can pre-order the Pixel 7a from the Google Store right now.

£30 per month for the Google Pixel 7 and 100GB of data

The Pixel 7 is one of the best phones we’ve reviewed this year, especially for the price. Now you can get it for an incredible price that includes 100GB of data on the Three network for just £30 per month, making it even more affordable. If you’re a keen mobile photographer, it’s an ideal handset for you.

When it comes to its overall look, the Pixel 7a doesn’t look too dissimilar to the flagship Pixel 7 – great for the budget model, but not so much for the flagship. In fact, reviewer Max Parker claimed that he could barely tell the difference between it and the Pixel 7 when first getting it out of the box.

There are some key differences though. While both Pixels sport the same aesthetics as previous flagship Pixels, complete with a protruding camera bar on the rear and pastel colour options, the Pixel 7a sports a slightly smaller 6.1-inch panel compared to the 6.3-inch screen of the standard Pixel 7.

The Pixel 7a is the first budget Pixel to make the move from 60Hz to the same 90Hz as the Pixel 7, which is extremely welcome considering plenty of budget- and mid-range phones these days tend to have a high refresh rate – though most of the competition clock in at 120Hz.

Elsewhere, you can look forward to IP67 dust and water resistance, and it’ll also be available in four attractive colours – Charcoal, Snow, Sea and Coral – with new matching Pixel Buds A in Sea to allow you to colour coordinate between your phone and accessories.

Aside from the display, it’s the cameras that have seen the biggest year-on-year upgrade with the 64MP main sensor boasting a sensor that’s a whopping 72% larger than that of the Pixel 6a, which should translate to impressive performance, especially as light levels begin to drop, and it can capture flagship-level 4K@60fps video too.

That’s paired with an upgrade 13MP ultrawide lens with a 120-degree FOV for expansive shots and a new 13MP front camera, both with support for 4K@30fps video capture.

Of course, hardware is only half of the story with the Pixel smartphones, and the phone uses the upgraded chipset – which we’ll come to in a sec – to provide a bevvy of AI-powered features like Super Res Zoom and Motion Unblur. There’s also a new Long Exposure mode, made possible by that new large main sensor.

As you might expect with previous ‘a’ entries using flagship chipsets, the Google Pixel 7a shares the same Google-designed Tensor G2 chipset as the flagship Google Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, as well as the top-end Google Pixel Fold also announced at Google I/O.

This not only provides flagship-level performance at a cheap mid-range price tag – something not offered by most rivals – but it allows the Pixel 7a to do magic with AI.

That includes the Pixel Call Assist feature in the US that allows you to automatically direct your call to the right department when dealing with automated phone systems, estimated wait times when put on hold and more. It also has the Pixel Speech features enabled by the T2 on the flagship Pixels including Live Translate, Recorder Speaker Labels and more.

It also allows for some truly impressive photo capabilities including Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur, previously exclusive to the flagship Pixels.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a Camera test
Publisher: DXOMARK

Text: We put the Google Pixel 7a through our rigorous DXOMARK Camera test suite to measure its performance in photo, video, and zoom quality from an end-user perspective. This article breaks down how the device fared in a variety of tests and several common use cases and is intended to highlight the most important results of our testing with an extract of the captured data.

The Google Pixel 7a delivered an excellent performance for its class in our DXOMARK Camera tests, and showed some improvement over its predecessor the Pixel 6a. The Pixel 7a features less-sophisticated hardware than the Pixel 7 Pro and lacks a dedicated tele camera, like the Pixel 7,  but it uses the same Google Tensor G2 chipset as the other Pixel 7-series devices.

Overall, image results were pretty close to the Pixel 7, especially in the photo and zoom categories, but the 7a did not quite match the more expensive model in terms of video detail. In still imaging our testers were particularly pleased by the 7a’s color and skin tone rendering. When zooming, the 7a did well at the ultra-wide end of the zoom range, but the lack of a dedicated tele lens meant that tele zoom image detail wasn’t quite on the same level as some competitors, such as the Xiaomi 13. In video mode, the Pixel 7a performed generally well in most conditions, but had some weaknesses in terms of color and detail rendering.

Despite some minor niggles, the Google Pixel 7a is an easy recommendation to anyone shopping for great camera performance in the High End segment.

In our Friend & Family use case tests, the Pixel 7a benefited from its nice color rendering and skin tones as well as good target exposure in most conditions. On the downside, the slightly limited depth of field means it’s not the best pick for group portraits with subjects in different planes.

In dimly lit environments, the camera’s ability to capture detail and color was on par with more expensive smartphones. This was largely due to the Pixel 7a’s large image sensor and wide aperture, which allow it to capture a lot of light and keep image noise at bay.

About DXOMARK Camera tests: DXOMARK’s Camera evaluations take place in laboratories and in real-world situations using a wide variety of subjects. The scores rely on objective tests for which the results are calculated directly by measurement software on our laboratory setups, and on perceptual tests in which a sophisticated set of metrics allow a panel of image experts to compare aspects of image quality that require human judgment. Testing a smartphone involves a team of engineers and technicians for about a week. Photo, Zoom, and Video quality are scored separately and then combined into an Overall score for comparison among the cameras in different devices. For more information about the DXOMARK Camera protocol, click here. More details on smartphone camera scores are available here. The following section gathers key elements of DXOMARK’s exhaustive tests and analyses. Full performance evaluations are available upon request. Please contact us  on how to receive a full report.

In our tests, the Google Pixel 7a delivered an excellent performance for still images, ranking second in its price segment, just behind its cousin Google Pixel 7. Our experts particularly liked the camera’s color and skin tone rendering. Exposure was good in most conditions as well, with a pretty wide dynamic range resulting in good detail in the highlight and shadow areas of the frame. The autofocus reacted quickly and worked accurately but a shallow depth of field meant that objects in front of or behind the main subject in the scene were out of focus.

Images showed high levels of detail in most light conditions but could not quite match the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. Compared to the other 7-series devices, we also observed higher noise levels when taking pictures indoors or in low light.

The Google Pixel 7a delivered good exposure in most test conditions but our experts did observe occasional underexposure in difficult portrait scenes. The camera’s dynamic range was fairly wide and on par with most direct competitors in the segment.

Color rendering is one of the Google Pixel 7 series’ strengths and the Pixel 7a was no exception, thanks to a neutral white balance, nice skin tones and beautiful colors in most test conditions.

The Google Pixel 7a autofocus system was fast and accurate in most conditions, allowing for quick and sharp capture of subjects, even in challenging light conditions.

The Google Pixel 7a captured high levels of detail, in some test scenes higher than its direct competitors, even in difficult light conditions. However, a shallow depth of field meant that scene elements in front of or behind the main subject were less sharp.

The Google Pixel 7a managed to keep image noise levels well under control when shooting in bright light. When taking pictures indoors or in low light, some noise became noticeable, but the Pixel was still doing better in dim conditions than most of its direct rivals.

In our tests, we found a range of unwanted artifacts in the Pixel 7a’s image output, but fusion artifacts and ghosting were the most noticeable ones.

The Pixel 7a’s portrait mode managed to combine the camera’s pleasant skin tone rendering with accurate depth estimation and subject isolation. The result was a nice bokeh effect with a natural blur gradient, making the Pixel a decent choice for shooting DSLR-style portrait images.

In our tests, the Google Pixel 7a’s image preview on the display was generally reliable, with a similar exposure and dynamic range to the final capture. However, in portrait mode the simulated bokeh effect was not displayed in the preview.

The Google Pixel 7a comes with a dedicated ultra-wide camera, with a very wide field of view for its class, allowing the photographer to squeeze a lot of scene into the frame. In our tests the ultra-wide camera produced accurate exposures and nice color. The trade-off between texture and noise was good, too. The lack of a dedicated tele lens meant that there was a noticeable loss of detail at medium range and longer tele settings when zooming in, though.

In terms of video zoom, the Pixel 7a has been slightly improved over its predecessor but the difference is small. When using the video zoom feature, there was still a noticeable loss of detail which, given the lack of a dedicated tele lens, was to be expected.

The Pixel’s ultra-wide camera offers a 13.7mm equivalent focal length, allowing for the capture of a wide field of view. Overall, image results from the ultra-wide were noticeable better than on the Pixel 7, and the 7a also outperformed its direct rivals Xiaomi 13 and Apple iPhone 14. When shooting with the ultra-wide camera, exposure was accurate and stable. While dynamic range could be slightly limited in difficult lighting situations, it was still wider than on most rivals in the class. Color was generally nice, with a natural white balance, but in some bright light and indoor scenes a white balance cast could be noticeable. The ultra-wide camera also captured good detail. Generally only slight noise was visible, but it was amplified in the shadow regions of the frame by Google’s HDR processing. Unwanted image artifacts were well under control, though.

When applying tele zoom, the camera captured fairly good detail at close range settings. However, without a dedicated tele lens a loss of detail was noticeable at medium and long range tele, as tele zoom is achieved by digital means only. Overall, tele performance was similar to the iPhone 14, but worse compared to the Xiaomi 13, which comes with a dedicated 75mm tele sensor module. Colors were accurate and exposure was generally good but our testers observed some underexposure in high-contrast scenes. We also noticed some image noise.

In this close range sample the level of detail was acceptable.

However, at long range a stronger loss of detail was noticeable than on the Xiaomi 13.

In video mode, the Google Pixel 7a was tested at 4K resolution and 30 frames per second. The device performed generally well in most conditions, but revealed some weaknesses in terms of color and detail rendering. The camera had a tendency to render color either dull or oversaturated, and the level of recorded detail was fairly low. On the plus side, video stabilization was effective, target exposure was generally accurate with wide dynamic range, and the autofocus was smooth.

Target exposure was generally accurate in most test conditions, but on some occasions we observed a lack of contrast, especially in bright outdoor light. Our testers also noticed some slight exposure instabilities in bright light. Dynamic range was fairly wide.

In indoor conditions and low light the Pixel 7a’s color rendering left some room for improvement. Color saturation was either too high or too low, resulting in unnaturally red or orange skin tones in low light. White balance casts were well managed but some instabilities were sometimes noticeable, especially in areas of plain color, such as blue skies. These instabilities were generally only noticeable when the camera was moving during recording.

The camera’s video autofocus was generally smooth and stable. Slight stepping or focus failures could occur during scene changes under suboptimal light conditions, but the Google device did overall well in the video autofocus category.

In video mode, our testers found the Pixel 7a to struggle with detail preservation. Texture rendering was slightly below what we could see on the comparison devices across all light conditions. However, the difference was most noticeable at lower light levels.

The Google Pixel 7a did well at controlling noise in video mode and noise levels were low in most conditions. Some slight chroma noise could be visible in the sky in outdoor scenes as well as areas of plain color when recording indoors. Temporal and luminance noise were well controlled in bright light and under typical indoor conditions but became noticeable in low light.

Video stabilization was very effective when holding the camera still while recording but some camera shake became noticeable when walking or running. Occasionally our testers also observed sharpness differences between frames, like in the sample clip below.

Unwanted video artifacts were generally well managed on the Pixel 7a, but we saw some ringing, mostly outdoor and indoor conditions.

In addition, ghosting could be spotted on moving elements in low light scenes.

The Pixel 7A has many of the features that the Pixel 6A was missing, at a lower price than the Pixel 7.      Lisa Eadicicco is a senior editor for CNET covering mobile devices.

Many of the same features as the Pixel 7 at a cheaper price

Only three generations of Android OS updates compared with Samsung's four-generation pledge

Good news, Pixel fans: the Pixel 7 just got $100 cheaper. Well, not really. But it might as well have. Even though Google still charges $599 for its flagship Pixel, it just launched the $499 (£449, AU$749) Pixel 7A -- which includes many of the same benefits at a lower price. (See our full Pixel 7A preorder guide for the current best deals, including a $50 gift card at Amazon, and a free case and headphones at the Google Store.) Google announced the Pixel 7A at , its annual developer conference where it typically introduces new products and updates to existing ones. Other than the Pixel 7A, which is available now, Google also debuted the Pixel Fold, a new Pixel Tablet and a slew of new AI-powered features for search and other services.       This advertising widget is powered by Navi and contains advertisements that Navi may be paid for in different ways.

The Pixel 7A gains a 90Hz screen for smoother graphics and scrolling, along with wireless charging and face unlock. Though those may not be must-haves for everyone, they're common features that the Pixel 6A lacked. Otherwise, the Pixel 7A has the same Tensor G2 processor as the Pixel 7, a new 64-megapixel main camera and a 6.1-inch screen just like its predecessor. Since the Pixel 7A runs on Google's mobile processor, you can expect many of the same Pixel-specific features seen on other devices, like the phone app's Hold for Me setting, Google's Recorder app and the company's Real Tone photo processing tech, which is meant to render skin tones more realistically.   Google's Pixel 7A stands up to the Pixel 7. Taken together, these changes help bridge the gap between the Pixel 7A and the Pixel 7. At the same time, it can also make the buying decision more complicated if you're shopping for a new Pixel device. Google Pixel 7A looks a lot like the Pixel 7 Like the Pixel 6A, the Pixel 7A borrows design cues from its pricier predecessor. That includes the camera bar, which has a matte metallic finish that almost matches the one on the Pixel 7. The Pixel 7A's camera strip is slightly thinner than the Pixel 7's, marking one of the few noticeable physical differences between the two devices. The Pixel 7A is also available in different color options compared with the Pixel 7. You can pick up Google's cheaper phone in white, black, light blue or  bright orange, while the Pixel 7 comes in white, light yellow or black.  The Pixel 7A has a camera bar that's similar to the Pixel 7's. The Pixel 7A is attractive for a phone in this price range, much like the Pixel 6A. Part of me wonders if Google's approach to design with its A-series phones motivated Samsung to up its game, too. The Galaxy A54 5G, which costs $450 and is Samsung's direct competitor to the Pixel 7A, has a glossy finish that makes it feel more premium than last year's Galaxy A53 5G.  The Pixel 7A has a 6.1-inch screen; the same size as the Pixel 6A's and slightly smaller than the 6.3-inch screen on the Pixel 7. If you prefer smaller phones, you may find the Pixel 7A easier to use with one hand compared with the Pixel 7. I personally find 6.1 inches to be the right screen size for a phone, since it provides enough space to comfortably read and watch videos without feeling overwhelming to operate. The biggest change Google made to the Pixel 7A's screen is its ability to switch the refresh rate between 60Hz and 90Hz depending on what's on the screen. With this setting turned on, navigating the operating system and scrolling through apps felt smooth and slick. Truthfully, I didn't always notice a huge difference compared with the Pixel 6A, which has a standard 60Hz screen.But there were some cases when flipping through my Twitter feed felt noticeably speedy on the Pixel 7A. Regardless, it's great to see Google incorporating more premium features into its less expensive devices, especially as higher refresh rates are starting to become the norm.It also helps Google stay more competitive with Samsung, which often trickles high-end features down to its own budget Galaxy phones. The Galaxy A54 5G can increase its refresh rate up to 120Hz, for example, similar to Samsung's high-end Galaxy S devices.   The Pixel 7A can increase its screen's refresh rate up to 90Hz. Google also says it bumped up the Pixel 7A's brightness, which would address one of my biggest complaints about the Pixel 6A. Unfortunately, I didn't notice much of a difference. Though I had no problem using the Pixel 7A at 50% brightness or lower indoors, I still had to crank it up to between 75% and 100% outdoors.  Both the Pixel 7A and Galaxy A54 5G are capable of reaching 1,000 nits of brightness at their maximum setting. However, even at lower settings, the Galaxy A54 5G's screen looked noticeably brighter alongside the Pixel 7A's.  Google Reveals Its AI-Powered Search Engine to Keep Up With Competition  The Pixel 7A's camera is comparable to the Pixel 7's. The Pixel 7A has an impressive camera that produced results similar to the Pixel 7's. The Pixel 7A has a 64-megapixel main camera and a 13-megapixel ultrawide camera, as shown below, both of which have a higher resolution than the Pixel 7's main and ultrawide camera.Even though the Pixel 7A's main camera has more megapixels than the step-up model, Google says the Pixel 7's main camera is more light sensitive and, more importantly, has a larger sensor. But most of the time, I could barely tell the difference between photos taken on the Pixel 7A and the Pixel 7. There were some instances where the Pixel 7 captured more detail, but I had to zoom in on my monitor to tell. I even thought the Pixel 7A did a better job than the Pixel 7 at capturing a portrait of my husband near a window in a mix of indoor and outdoor lighting.The Pixel 6A has a great camera that snaps crisp and colorful photos, especially for a phone under $400. However, I noticed the Pixel 7A sometimes exposed the subject better, as shown in the zoomed photo of a stop sign below and the photo of my husband. The Pixel 6A was also noticeably slower than the Pixel 7A when taking photos in Night Mode. (Since the Pixel 6A was slower, my cat moved midshot, as you can see below). I generally prefer the Pixel 7A's camera over the Galaxy A54's, since Samsung's phone made colors look over exposed when shooting outdoors. But the Galaxy A54 5G performed well in a few of my tests, especially when shooting low-light photos. It also has a closer digital zoom than the Pixel 7A, Pixel 7 and Pixel 6A, though its photo came out grainier.The Pixel 7A's 13-megapixel front camera can take a great selfie. During my testing against the Pixel 7, Pixel 6A and Galaxy A54, the 7A's selfie was my favorite because it had the right mix of detail, color accuracy and softening to make my face look flattering. The Pixel 7A can shoot 4K video at up to 60 frames per second, just like the Pixel 7, and footage shot on the two phones looked very similar. You also get many of the same camera shooting modes, backend tech and editing tricks found on the Pixel 7, such as Magic Eraser, Photo Unblur and Real Tone, which you can read more about in my Pixel 7 review. However, the Pixel 7A doesn't have the Pixel 7's Action Pan, which focuses sharply on a moving subject and blurs the background. But it does have Long Exposure mode, unlike the Pixel 6A, which has neither of those features. The bottom line: Even though the Pixel 7 technically has a more advanced camera according to Google, the Pixel 7A's camera will be just fine for casual photographers. The Pixel 7A should be plenty adequate for the average phone user who primarily wants to take great photos of vacations, family gatherings and social occasions. Those who really want the best camera on a Pixel phone should opt for the Pixel 7 Pro, which has a dedicated telephoto lens and other extras.The Pixel 7A can get through a full day on a single charge, though battery life will always vary depending on the phone's settings and which apps you're using. My experience varied a little depending on my circumstances. On a lighter day of use spent mostly at home, I used the Pixel 7A for basic tasks like checking email, playing games for 10 minutes, exporting a few videos and taking photos for roughly 20 minutes. I had 41% of my battery left after about 16 hours. But on a busier day, when I commuted into the office, streamed music for about an hour during my subway ride and made a video call, the battery was down to 20% after about 13 hours of use. I tried to keep the brightness at 50% on both days, but there were times on both occasions when I set it higher while outdoors. During my testing, I also left the high refresh rate setting turned on and the always-on display option switched off -- both of those can impact battery performance.I ran a 45-minute endurance test that consists of streaming video, making a video call, playing games, browsing social media, and general miscellaneous use to see how much those activities would drain the battery after a full charge. The Pixel 7A had 92% of its battery left after that test, which puts it on par with the Galaxy S23 (91%) but lower than the Pixel 7 (94%).I also streamed a YouTube video to see how much doing so would drain the battery over the course of three hours. The Pixel 7A performed slightly better than the Pixel 7 on this test, though the results were close. One major aspect new to the Pixel 7A is wireless charging. Though the ability to power up your phone by resting it on a compatible charger has been standard on many phones for years, it's typically missing from budget-minded devices. The Pixel 6A doesn't have wireless charging, for example, and neither does the Galaxy A54 5G.The Pixel 7A's wireless charging speed is slower than the Pixel 7's (7.5 watts versus 12W on the Pixel 7 with a compatible qi-certified charger), and it took 30 minutes to charge from 37% to 47%.   The Pixel 7A runs on Google's Tensor G2 processor, like the Pixel 7. The Pixel 7A runs on Google's Tensor G2 processor, which feels smooth and fluid when performing daily tasks, whether that's playing a mobile game, scrolling through apps or snapping photos. Performance is rarely a concern on major smartphone releases from companies like Apple, Google, Samsung and OnePlus. But it's worth mentioning for a phone at this price, because cheaper phones can sometimes come with performance hiccups, as was the case when I reviewed the Galaxy A53 5G last year.Everyday performance felt speedy, but I did notice that the Pixel 7A exported video a bit more slowly than Google's other Pixels and Samsung's Galaxy A54 5G. On average, it took about 22.5 seconds for the Pixel 7A to export a 30-second 4K video to 1080p in Adobe Premiere Rush, which is slower than the Pixel 6A (20.2 seconds), Pixel 7 (18.3 seconds) and Galaxy A54 5G (15.6 seconds).Still, that Tensor G2 chip is more about the Pixel-specific features you get, rather than speed alone. Those include Google's Recorder app, Live Translate and Photo Unblur. Google's Pixel phones also have some handy phone-calling features, like Hold for Me, which allows Google to wait on the line in your stead. Tricks like these help set Pixel phones apart from other Android devices, though Samsung is trying to catch up by bringing more Galaxy-specific tricks to its own devices. The Pixel 7A launches with Android 13 and will get three years of Android version updates and five years of security updates. That matches the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro, but it's still behind Samsung, which pledges four generations of Android OS updates and five years of security updates. Pixel 7A, Pixel 7 or Pixel 6A: Which should you choose?  The Pixel 7A makes a hard case for buying the Pixel 7. Given all the similarities between the Pixel 7 and 7A, deciding between the two can be tricky. Google is keeping last year's Pixel 6A in the lineup for a newly discounted price of $349, making it a tempting choice for those on a budget.My advice? After spending a few days with the Pixel 7A, I can't come up with a compelling reason to choose the Pixel 7 instead. The Pixel 7A has the same processor, a great main camera and the same amount of memory and storage. By adding wireless charging and a smoother screen to the Pixel 7A, Google fixed the two major features the Pixel 6A was missing. The Pixel 6A still has plenty to offer at its new price, including a capable camera and Google's Pixel-specific software features. If you prefer to save money and don't mind sacrificing wireless charging, face unlock, and extra photo tools like long exposure mode, the Photo Unblur editing tool and faster night mode capture, then the Pixel 6A is still a worthwhile choice.However, it's worth considering Google's software update cycle. Since the Pixel 7A launched later than the Pixel 7 and Pixel 6A, it'll get Android version updates for a longer period of time. That could be a good reason to choose the Pixel 7A over the 6A.  The Pixel 7A feels like the best value in a Pixel device. The Pixel 7A feels like the best value for Pixel fans right now. While you miss out on certain Pixel 7 extras, like battery share, the camera's Action Pan mode, a larger screen and slightly faster charging, none of those omissions feels like a deal-breaker. In my experience, camera performance is comparable between the two -- certainly enough to satisfy the average person. With the Pixel 7A, it's clear Google is leaning into competitive pricing as a major part of its effort to bring more Android users into the world of Pixel. My only concern is that Google may be blurring the line a bit too much between its A-series Pixel and regular Pixel. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad Google brought most of the features I asked for to the Pixel 7A. It just means I'll be expecting more from the Pixel 8. was actually used in the real world. We test a phone's features, play games and take photos. We examine the display to see if it's bright, sharp and vibrant. We analyze the design and build to see how it is to hold and whether it has an IP-rating for water resistance.

Softtitle: Google’s Pixel 7A Raises the Bar for Sub-$500 Phones
Publisher: WIRED
Author: Condé Nast

Text: The past week has been one of the busiest I've ever had. I flew to Dallas, Texas, for a friend's wedding, drove to Austin to visit an in-law, drove back for the wedding festivities, then flew back to New York, only to head out to San Francisco the next day for Google I/O 2023. The good news is that the new Google Pixel 7A has been in my pocket all the while, through every leg and layover, and it's never felt limited in any deal-breaking way. This is a $499 phone, and it's just more evidence that you really don't need to spend much more than that to get a good experience these days.

Is it the perfect phone? No. There are features missing here that some folks would want. Also, battery life is just OK, and the price has been hiked up $50 from last year's model. To remedy this, Google is continuing to sell last year's Pixel 6A at a lower price—$349—though you can routinely find it for sale at $299. That phone is still a good buy at either of those prices, but should you feel the need to spend a bit more, the Pixel 7A has just about everything you'd need.

The Pixel 7A mimics the design of the Pixel 7 and Pixel 6 series that came before. It's clean and unique, and it's easy to spot in a sea of iPhones and Samsungs—good if you want to feel different. It comes in Charcoal (black), Sea (baby blue), Snow (white), and Coral (orangey pink), the latter of which is exclusive to the Google Store. The blue is a little too faint for me—it often looks white—but the Coral is drop-dead gorgeous. I love a flashy phone.

The phone's frame is made of recycled aluminum, and the back is a plastic composite that by no means feels cheap. (It's also one less spot for cracked glass in case you drop the phone!) The front is made with Gorilla Glass 3, a product which is several years old at this point and isn't as scratch- and crack-resistant as modern formulations from Corning, the company that creates the hardened glass. Using older Gorilla Glass is one of the easy ways to bring down the price of a handset. Safe to say, even if the back can't crack as easily, it's worth getting a case. This Pixel is IP67-rated for water and dust resistance though, so a drop in the pool won't destroy it.

The 6.1-inch OLED screen hasn't shown any weaknesses, even when I stared at it while walking in full sun (not to mention 94-degree heat paired with disgusting levels of humidity) in Austin. Is it as bright as the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G, the Pixel's closest competitor? No, but I rarely had to squint to read the display. You're treated to a 90-Hz refresh rate as well, which means everything from playing games to scrolling Instagram feels more fluid, as the screen is outputting more frames per second than traditional 60-Hz screens. It's a nice perk.

Performance is not an issue either. The Pixel 7A packs Google's Tensor G2 chipset with 8 gigabytes of RAM, the very same stack that powers its flagship Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. I've never seen the 7A stutter in my time with the phone. This chipset means you get access to many of the same G2-specific software features that debuted on the Pixel 7 series, such as Long Exposure in the camera app and Photo Unblur, which did effectively unblur some faces in my photos of the dance floor at the wedding.

The Pixel 7A is one of the few sub-$500 phones to feature wireless charging, and it's about damn time this started showing up in cheaper phones. It's so much nicer to plop your phone on a stand instead of hunting for a cable. That said, the 7A does skip some other niceties you might have liked to see, like a headphone jack, a microSD card slot, and a wall charger in the box (though you do get a USB-C to USB-C cable). The phone is also limited to 128 GB of internal storage; it'd be nice if Google took a page from Motorola and started offering 256 gigs.

Google has long had a lackluster in-display fingerprint sensor, and unfortunately the Pixel 7A follows that same path. On my first day of use, I had to put my thumb on the sensor a few times for it to unlock. It got drastically better over time, but I still needed to be more conscious and deliberate about finger placement than I was on other phones such as the aforementioned A54. It's just not a great sensor.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a review: all you really need

Text: The Pixel A-series regularly delivers some of the best camera image processing you can get from a phone without dropping serious cash on a flagship. That was still the case for last year’s Pixel 6a, but it was in danger of being left behind in other areas – ones affordable alternatives were only too happy to deliver. The Google Pixel 7a feels like a return to status quo.

Google has taken the best bits of its pricier Pixel 7 and diluted them, ever so slightly, to hit a more wallet-friendly price point. The top-tier CPU remains; features like a high refresh rate screen and wireless charging make the cut for the first time; and the main camera gets an all-new, high pixel count sensor to maximise detail and low light performance. The price has climbed as a result – is there enough here to earn a place on our best budget phones list?

At first glance you might wonder whether Google has changed anything about the A-series’ design between generations, but get the Google Pixel 7a in your hand and it immediately feels like a classier handset than the outgoing 6a. The recycled aluminium frame now extends to the distinctive camera shelf at the rear of the phone, and is a near-perfect match for the pricier Pixel 7.

The shelf doesn’t stick out quite as far here, and the display bezels are slightly thicker. Power and volume keys at the side match the frame’s matte finish, too, instead of reusing the polished and shiny buttons seen on the Pixel 7. It’s not a whole lot smaller, either, so you’ll need to be paying close attention to tell which phone is which.

The rear is still made from polycarbonate (ie plastic) and still picks up fingerprints at an astonishing rate. They might be less noticeable on the Sea, Snow and Coral colours (the latter being exclusive to the Google Store) than our Charcoal review unit. IP67 water resistance makes a welcome return, and Gorilla Glass promises a degree of protection for the screen.

You get the choice of face and fingerprint unlocking, although only the latter can be used to authenticate banking apps and the like. Both were able to recognise us quickly, and the under-display fingerprint sensor is placed a sensible distance from the edge of the phone so you can reach it easily.

Screen size and resolution haven’t changed from last year, meaning the Google Pixel 7a gets a 2400×1080 OLED panel stretched across 6.1in. That’s refreshingly compact in a world where even affordable Android phones average 6.5in or larger.

The big upgrade is to refresh rate, which now tops out at 90Hz. It might not match 120Hz rivals like the Nothing Phone 1 for fluid motion, but is a big improvement on the Pixel 6a and its 60Hz display. You can’t force it on constantly, with Google dynamically switching between 60 and 90Hz based on what’s onscreen. It’s also disabled by default, needing a trip to the Settings menu to turn it on. But seeing how much smoother it makes every swipe and web page scroll feel, you’re going to want to take the minor hit to battery life.

Epic contrast and punchy colours are par for the course for an OLED panel, so the Pixel 7a duly delivers. Still images and videos have plenty of pop, while still staying true to life. The Natural colour preset dials things back a little if things seem oversaturated out of the box, but there’s no fine-grain control over temperature or tone. Still, it’s as sharp, saturated and well defined as any mid-range rival.

The screen is considerably brighter than last year’s model, which already had a brightness boost mode that kicked in when you stepped outside. It’s not as retina-scorching as more expensive alternatives, but we had no trouble using it in bright sunshine, and viewing angles are great. The flat panel doesn’t have to content with light reflections like curved glass phones do, either.

Not much seems to have changed on the audio front, but that’s no bad thing: the Pixel 6a’s stereo speakers did a fine job for podcast listening or YouTube playback, and the 7a sounds just as clear. The down-firing driver and earpiece tweeter don’t have any real bass, but vocals are clear and there’s ample volume. Google would quite like to sell you a pair of Pixel Buds A-Series for personal listening, so you won’t find a 3.5mm headphone port here.

Older A-series phones did plenty with their modest camera sensors, but the 7a follows in the footsteps of the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro with a 64MP main snapper. As well as a significantly higher pixel count than last year’s Pixel 6a, the sensor is also physically larger, meaning it can capture a lot more light every time you press the shutter button. Pics are downsampled to 16MP, with Google’s consistently superb image processing algorithms then stepping in before you see the finished shot.

We were blown away by the amount of detail on show, with both close-ups and distance shots displaying fantastic clarity for the cash. And while it can’t deliver the natural depth of field that a flagship phone with a 1in sensor or physical lens aperture can, portraits do still show some pretty background blur. In some scenes you’d easily think photos were shot on hardware costing several times the price.

Google’s processing still leans towards heavier shadows and a more natural colour balance than either Samsung or Apple, who deliver a slightly punchier presentation, but dynamic range was consistently fantastic, exposure well judged and noise almost completely absent. Skin tones remain very well judged for the most part thanks to the firm’s Real Tone skin tone mapping, and autofocus was always quick to pick out our subjects. We did notice a few of our shots leaned more heavily towards red tones than we’d expect, though.

Night Sight kicks in automatically in very low light, and while it still needs a second or two of steady hands for the sharpest shots, detail is once again very impressive. Even without it, colours stay accurate and noise is kept to a minimum. It’s here where the gap between the 7a and the much more expensive competition widens, but not by as much as you’d think.

The main camera is backed up by a 13MP ultrawide lens, which misses out on the Macro Focus close-up abilities of the pricier Pixel 7 Pro. Colour balance, dynamic range and exposure are very closely matched, and it isn’t short on detail either. There’s some softening at the edges on account of lens correction, and low light performance isn’t quite as good, but it otherwise puts in an impressive showing that few similarly-priced rivals can match.

There’s no dedicated telephoto lens (hardly a surprise given the price), although Google’s Super Res zoom adds up to 8x magnification with impressive surface clarity. They don’t hold up quite as well under scrutiny, but are perfectly usable between 2x and 4x – a great showing for a mid-range phone.

Long exposure is a fun new addition to the A-series range, which (like the rest of the camera app) does most of the heavy lifting for you. There are no settings to tweak, just point, shoot and hold steady for a few seconds, even in bright light. It works best at night though, creating funky light trail effects with very little effort.

Selfie lovers will appreciate the front-facing camera’s resolution bump, up from 8MP in the Pixel 6a to 13MP here. The shots it takes are detailed, colourful and noise-free in good light, with only a slight softening once you step indoors. Finer facial details are captured and dynamic range is very respectable. It’ll also manage 4K video at 30fps, which is unheard of from the current crop of cut-price Chinese competition.

The Pixel 7a inherits its Tensor G2 CPU from its bigger brothers, meaning this mid-range phone has the firepower of a full-on flagship. Android feels perfectly peppy as a result, opening apps quickly and happily running two at once in split-screen. 8GB of RAM ensures it’s a better multitasker than the outgoing Pixel 6a, and Google’s bespoke Titan M2 chip handles hardware-level security. Snapdragon 8 Gen 2-powered phones costing twice as much still have it licked for raw performance, but unless you care deeply about benchmark scores you’re unlikely to care.

It handles games well too. Demanding gacha RPG Honkai: Star Rail defaults to mostly high settings, and ran with only a few minor hitches when transitioning between levels or battles got especially hectic. That’s a great showing for a mid-range phone, and means most 3D games available in the Play Store will run just fine. The Pixel 7a has zero issues playing simpler, 2D titles.

128GB of storage is about what we’d expect for the cash, although unlike some rivals Google won’t sell you a higher capacity model for more money. Buyers qualify for discounted Google One cloud storage, in case you find yourself running low on space.

The Pixel 7a drops with Android 13 on board, although you can rest assured it’ll be first in line for Android 14 once Google releases it. At least five years of security patches are planned, which is great if you’re shopping for a long-haul handset, and it’ll get semi-regular Feature Drops like the rest of the Pixel line-up.

There’s no pre-installed bloat, just a full selection of Google-made apps, and the interface is just as its maker intended: easy to navigate and a joy to customise, thanks to Material You theming which colour-codes app icons and UI elements to match your wallpaper. Recent additions like Google One VPN and Clear Calling, which automatically cuts out background noise during voice calls, are ready to use out of the box.

With a 4385mAh battery, the Pixel 7a squeezes in more cells than the Samsung Galaxy S23, which costs twice the price. That capacity also ever-so-slightly edges out the standard Pixel 7, but both phones have near-identical lifespans away from the mains.

Google’s 24 hour estimate felt a little optimistic to us, although that could be because the adaptive battery mode had yet to learn which apps we used most frequently. We still comfortably lasted all day in mixed use, taking lots of photos, watching a few Netflix shows, scrolling through social apps and streaming music to our Bluetooth headphones. You can usually hold off charging until the next morning, rather than plugging in at bedtime.

Gaming takes a bigger toll on remaining juice, so play time should be rationed if you’re not going to be able to plug in for a while. Extreme battery saver can get you out of a pinch by pausing everything except critical apps, boosting standby time to as much as three days. Just don’t expect to use the phone for much more than calls or texts while it’s enabled.

Overall longevity falls behind battery champs like the more affordable Honor Magic 5 Lite, but stays on par with mid-range rivals that have bigger screens.

18W wired charging is what we’d call the bare minimum for a modern phone, and means you’re looking at multiple hours tethered to a plug socket to fully refuel the battery. Neither of the more expensive Pixels are much faster though, and none come with a power brick in the box, so you aren’t missing out by sticking with the 7a. Chinese alternatives like the Redmi Note 12 Pro+ remain leagues ahead here.

Wireless charging is a pleasant surprise, though, and something only found on the Nothing Phone 1 at this price point. It isn’t especially speedy at a mere 7.5W, but is still handy for a cable-free refill.

With zippy performance, a battery that can go all day between top ups, and a pair of cameras that take superb photos for the cash, the Google Pixel 7a once again proves an A-series is almost all the phone an Android fan needs. That it now looks and feels like a pricier device, thanks to nicer materials and a higher refresh rate screen, only highlights the exceptional value. It comfortably outmuscles direct rivals like the Samsung Galaxy A54, and takes better pics than the slightly more affordable Nothing Phone 1.

A slightly larger screen, marginally faster charging and a few extra camera modes are now all that separate it from the pricier Pixel 7. That might be bad news for Google’s bottom line, but is fantastic for customers – even with the £50 price hike over last year’s effort.

Unless you’re looking to spend almost double the cash on a flagship with even more versatile cameras, the Pixel 7a won’t leave you wanting for anything.

Text: While Google's flagship phones are widely celebrated, perhaps the most significant devices it produces are lower down the scale. The Pixel A has given us a run of great devices, highlighted for their affordability, while holding on to many flagship specs.

The Pixel 7a follows a widely-lauded Pixel 6a, an established formula that might lead to a foregone conclusion: the 7a offers specs close to the Pixel 7, yet it's more affordable. Is that the end of the story? Not quite.

POCKET-LINT VIDEO OF THE DAYSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT

The Google Pixel 7a offers flagship power and the Pixel camera in an affordable package, closing the gap with the Pixel 7. The price is creeping up, however, so if you want that great camera, you might want to wait for the inevitable discounts.   $499  at Amazon $499 at Best Buy

The Google Pixel 7a was announced on 10 May 2023 and went on sale immediately. There's no pre-order for this device, it's just available to buy immediately, priced at $499 in the US and £449 in the UK.

It will be widely available, but the Coral colour will be exclusive to the Google Store, so you'll have to buy it there if that's the colour you want.

The Google Pixel 7a sticks to an established design language, using the camera bar across the back to divide the rear of the phone. This camera bar - as per the Pixel 7 - is higher quality giving the Pixel 7a an upgraded look over the Pixel 6a. The camera bar on the 6a looked a little basic, but the Pixel 7a is far from it. Perhaps that's designed to convince buyers that the $50 bump in price is worth it over the old phone.

There are four colours being offered: Charcoal, Sea, Snow and Coral - the latter of which is a Google Store exclusive. There's no two-tone fun here, they are now single colours, the metal frame and camera bar matching the rest of the phone, which wasn't the case with the Pixel 6a. Again, the colouration of the metal makes for a higher-quality look. However, the important IP67 protection remains, so there's no need to worry about the odd dunk or when you get caught in the rain.

The Pixel 7a comes in smaller than the Pixel 7 because of the smaller display, but it's thicker, and it feels thicker when you hold it despite being a smaller phone. That partly comes down to having a flatter display, so there isn't such a pronounced curve to the edges to make the phone feel slimmer. So although it's perhaps better suited to those who don't want a huge phone, you might actually find the Pixel 7 nicer to hold. The Pixel 7a also has a pretty wide border or bezel around the display, which takes it down a notch from flagship design. It's also a glossy finish, so well worth protecting with a case to avoid the scratches.

Stereo speakers remain in place, able to put out appreciable volume and they're well placed, so you're unlikely to muffle them whatever you're doing, so it's good for gaming too. There's also support for hi-res music, so if you have a pair of headphones supporting LDAC, for example, you'll really be able to take advantage of better audio formats. There's no 3.5mm headphone socket, however.

The story of the Pixel 7a display is interesting, because there's little change from the Pixel 6a, except for the change in refresh rate. The move to 90Hz means that you'll get smoother scrolling in your apps, a step-up on the spec sheet over the older phone, and that helps make it more competitive against rivals. You can opt to stick with 60Hz, but we suspect many will just jump to 90Hz and stay there. There's no adaptive refresh option.

But otherwise this is a good quality display, with the full HD resolution fitting the size to give nice rich detail, with good colour saturation, so it's nice and vibrant. Setting it alongside the Pixel 7 Pro it's not as bright and there are moments when it looks a little dull, more obvious in daylight than darker conditions where the lack of peak brightness is less important.

There is enough brightness to deliver the HDR visuals and on balance, it's hard to criticise this display too much at this price, although if it's brightness you're after, you might find that Samsung's Galaxy A54 is a better choice when it comes to display.

There's a fingerprint scanner under the display which is fast to unlock and we've found it reliable enough in daily use. It's supported by face unlocking, but as was the case on the Pixel 7 models, this face unlocking only appears to apply to unlocking the device - it doesn't extend to unlocking other apps on your phone. Still, it's a faster way to get into your device when you look at it.

One of the headlines for this phone is that it uses the same Tensor G2 hardware as Google's flagship phone, the Pixel 7 Pro (and the Pixel 7 for that matter). Indeed, it's the same hardware that Google is using in the Pixel Tablet and the Pixel Fold, so you could say that you're getting a lot for your money.

The advantage of having top-notch hardware is that it supports all the features that you get elsewhere. Those little details like that hi-res audio support, the AI and everything else that Google packs in, means there aren't many compromises for picking a mid-range device. Yes, it's now a more expensive package than when Google performed this trick with the Pixel 6a, but there are few companies that offer this grade of hardware in this position of phone; it was one of the advantages of the iPhone SE, although Apple's cheaper phone has been hindered by an old design and the absence of some features. Sure, there's only 8GB RAM and only one storage option, but otherwise the hardware gives you a lot.

There's a 4385mAh battery, with the addition here being wireless charging, so it's a great opportunity to pick-up a wireless charger for your Pixel. That's going to be popular with those who want that convenience, but there's no reverse wireless charging as you'll find on the Pixel 7 Pro. The wired charging rate is 18W, not hugely fast, or 7.5W wireless, which again isn't hugely fast and this is one area where some rivals will have an advantage, giving you faster charging speeds. The battery life is good, with the Pixel 7a easily lasting through a typical day easily enough.

There's a dual camera system on the rear of the Pixel 7a, here comprising a main and ultrawide camera, with the 7a missing out on optical zoom. This also isn't the same camera as you'll find in the Pixel 7 or Pixel 7 Pro, which have a 50-megapixel main sensor compared to the 64-megapixel sensor used here. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that more megapixels automatically makes for a better camera, as not all sensors are equal.

It is, however, also a complete change from the Pixel 6a in terms of hardware. That marks new ground for Google, which had been pretty consistent with its cameras on the Pixel phones for a number of years. However, the important thing is that this is a Pixel camera, so it's not just about the optics and sensors, but about the processing that happens after you press the shutter button.

The ultrawide camera gives you creative options and the performance is good enough, but it needs to be used with consideration. Not because the ultrawide lens is bad, but because the management of lens switching isn’t as smooth as we'd want it to be. When you use the ultrawide and switch back to the main camera, it doesn't instantly switch to the other lens. Instead it crops on the ultrawide sensor to give you an undisturbed view. Unfortunately, if you're too fast to take the shot, you'll be taking that shot from the cropped ultrawide sensor - and it's possible for subsequent zoomed photos to come from that sensor too.

And there's a massive difference in the quality you'll get from the ultrawide and main camera - especially when it comes to zoom. So just be careful when moving from ultrawide to the main camera and into zoom - you'll see a little pulse in the display when the cameras switch and there's a good chance Google could fix this with a software update.

Otherwise, the Pixel displays the sort of strengths we've come to expect from the Pixel camera. The main sensor copes well in pretty much all conditions, capturing low light and night shots with skill and delivering great portrait images too. The edge detection is great, with processing just taking a second when you flip over to view your shot. Night Sight remains a great skill - not always matched at this price point, and now faster than it was on the Pixel 6a.

The hybrid zoom system is also capable, with Google using its computational photography to sharpen up images. The results end up being usable (as long as they range isn't too great), but they can't compete with a camera packing in a proper zoom lens.

It's not just the capturing of those images that's important, it's what happens to them afterwards, with options in Google Photos to use Magic Eraser or camouflage elements in photos, add background blur and a whole lot more. As a complete package - accepting there's that bug to be fixed - the Pixel 7a repeats Google's performance of delivering a camera that's great in all situations. Yes, there's no zoom, but at this price point, it's highly competitive and one of the best all-round packages.

The big advantage of choosing a Pixel, of course, is that it's Google-native hardware and front of the line when it comes to software updates. There's expected to be 4 years software updates on the Pixel 7a and 5 years of security updates - and you'll be the first to receive those updates to new versions of Android.

In addition, this is a bloat-free device, offering Google's apps and services all neatly integrated for a slick experience. There aren't many Android phones that have a software experience this clean at this sort of price, so if you're after a bloat-free experience without the clutter, then you should definitely look to the Pixel 7a.

The phone will also be updated with feature drops, where new features are rolled out to Pixel devices. This often introduces something new, often leveraging AI. Because the core hardware has the same power as Google's other devices, there's no reason why there shouldn't be parity between the Pixel 7a and other more expensive Pixel devices.

Indeed, about the only thing we've spotted that this phone doesn't do is the Action Pan mode in the camera. Otherwise, the experience is pretty much the same as on the Pixel 7 Pro, albeit on a smaller scale and in a device that's not quite as premium.

The Pixel 7a is a great offering in the mid-range offering performance that sits it in a competitive place. The biggest challenge that Google now faces is convincing you that this more expensive mid-ranger has the same appeal as the Pixel 6a. Although it's technically more advanced than the 6a, the move to over $/£400 immediately makes it look like it's slightly less attractive. Consider too, that discounts on the Pixel 7 mean that these two devices will often sit very close in terms of price. If that's the dilemma you're faced with, then pick the Pixel 7. It might be that potential customers want to wait for discounts before buying the Pixel 7a.

But taken for what it is, you have great camera performance, plenty of power and decent battery life. The camera is good - accepting there's a problem switching from ultrawide to main camera that you need to watch out for - but otherwise, this is a great package.

The $499 Pixel 7a looks, feels, and performs just like the Pixel 7, which just six months ago was a highly-rated flagship phone.

*  Hardware and design: Almost looks and feels like the Pixel 7

*  Performance: No complaints in this price range

*  Software: It's Android the way Google envisioned it

*  Should you buy the Google Pixel 7a?

There used to be a clear line separating the flagship Pixel series from the mid-range A phones. The former would be powered by the best Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, while the latter would settle for a lower-tier Snapdragon silicon. But that line blurred with the Pixel 6 series when Google began using its own silicon and gave the subsequent 6a series access to the same chip.

The parity between Google's flagship and mid-range line grows more this year with the Pixel 7a, which was just announced at Google I/O. Other than screen size, I'm not sure most people would be able to tell the difference between the Pixel 7 and 7a.

XDA VIDEO OF THE DAYSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT

This is great news for Pixel fans on a tighter budget since they're getting near flagship experience at a mid-range price, but then what's the point of the standard Pixel 7? Sure, there's a half-year gap between devices, but most consumers probably don't mind waiting a few extra months for a cheaper device. It's also odd for a flagship phone to be relevant for just half a year before another phone in the same family undercuts it.

I could be overthinking it, but the point is that the Pixel 7a is almost like a flagship phone, with a main camera that can go toe to toe with the best iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, at just $499. Any potential Android buyer who's trying to watch their budget should consider the Pixel 7a first.

About this review: This review was written after eight days of testing a Pixel 7a provided by Google. The company did not have input in this review.

Google's latest mid-ranger brings several improvements over last year's model, making it a great option for the budget conscious. The Pixel 7a packs the flagship Tensor G2 chip, flagship-tier cameras, an improved 90Hz display, more RAM, better durability, and wireless charging support. Pros Overall performance very close to the flagship Pixel 7 The best camera for a mid-ranger Easy on the eyes and easy to hold   Cons       $449 at Amazon $449 at Best Buy $499 at Google Store

The Google Pixel 7a goes on sale May 11. There's only one configuration with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, priced at $499 in the U. S. The phone will be available for purchase in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Ireland, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Norway, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Japan, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, and India.

Hardware and design: Almost looks and feels like the Pixel 7

The Pixel 7a and Pixel 7 are so similar that it'd be easier if I list out the differences right away. If you're already familiar with the Pixel 7, you would know exactly what the 7a offers.

The Pixel 7a, with a 6.1-inch screen, is smaller than the 6.3-inch Pixel 7   The Pixel 7a has a plastic back rather than the glass-backed Pixel 7   The Pixel 7a's main camera uses lower-tier hardware with a smaller sensor size compared to the Pixel 7's GN1 sensor

And while I will talk about the cameras more in-depth in the section below, I can say right now that the "weaker" camera hardware doesn't matter too much. Google's software image processing is so good it makes up the difference. So yeah, the Pixel 7a comes very close to giving the same experience as the Pixel 7, but at a lower price.

The Google Pixel 7a does come in two new colors (bright orange and light blue) that look great, but my unit came in white, which was already featured in the Pixel 7 series. I was disappointed, for about 30 seconds, then got over it, because the white colorway may still be the best-looking option. The stark white body with the metallic silver camera visor provides enough contrast for an understated, minimalist two-tone look.

Even though the Pixel 7a uses a plastic back, Google has applied a coating that makes it feel like glass, and it was enough to make me double-check the reviewer's guide. There are other slight areas of corner cutting to reach a lower price, such as the Pixel 7a's display being protected by Gorilla Glass 3 instead of Gorilla Glass Victus or the 7a having an IP67 rating instead of Pixel 7's IP68 (although the rating difference doesn't matter too much in real life scenarios unless you purposely take the phone underwater regularly).

With a relatively "small" flat screen, and weighing just 0.4 ounces, the Pixel 7a is very comfortable to hold and use with one hand. I'm just not a fan of the Pixel's power button placement, which sits a bit higher than usual and forces me to adjust my grip to press it (this wouldn't be a big deal if the Pixel had a "double-tap screen to lock" like almost all Android phones, but it does not).

The Pixel 7a's power button sits above the volume rocker

The bezels wrapping around the OLED screen are slightly thicker than other Android phones, but that's not a big deal, and the FHD+ (1080x2400) screen looks great indoors. However, maximum brightness, at about 1,200 nits, is below par compared to Samsung or Xiaomi's similarly priced phones. In direct sunlight, the Pixel 7a screen is definitely harder to see than any recent phone I have reviewed. But the screen did get an upgrade to 90Hz from the Pixel 6a's 60Hz, bringing it further in line with the Pixel 7. Stereo speakers and solid haptics complete the outer hardware package.

As mentioned, the Pixel 7a is powered by the same Google Tensor G2 chip as the Pixel 7 series. This chip is technically not as powerful as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (or even the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1). Most notably, its GPU is inferior, and it heats up quite badly during any gaming sessions longer than 10 minutes. The chip is also noticeably slower at things like editing and exporting videos. But what it lacks in raw power it makes up for in machine learning capabilities, which makes sense since it was custom-designed to handle Google's machine learning algorithms. But we'll talk more in the performance section.

The display did get an upgrade to 90Hz refresh rate this year (matching the Pixel 7), unlike the Pixel 6a's jarring 60Hz.

RAM and memory are fine at 8GB and 128GB, though the latter uses UFS 3.2 storage and not the latest UFS 4.0 (the flagship Pixel phones are also at UFS 3.2, for what it's worth). With no expandable storage support, however, the 128GB storage could run out fast, and Google apparently isn't providing another variant with more storage. I suppose Google is convinced its customers are very cloud-usage savvy.

The 4,385mAh battery is large for a phone of this size, but charging speeds are abysmally slow: 20W wired and 5W wireless. There's no charger included with the packaging, so I used an Anker 120W charger, which took 70 minutes to get the phone from zero to full.

The Pixel 7a's main camera hardware got an upgrade to a 64MP, f/1.9 sensor with a 1/1.7-inch image sensor size this year. This is a big step up from the Pixel 6a's puny 12MP, 1/2.5-inch sensor, but it's still smaller than the Pixel 7's 1/1.3, or Samsung Galaxy A54's 1/1.5-inch. In other words, Google improved the camera hardware by its own standards, but this is still just modest camera hardware, even at this price range.

But as has always been the case with Pixels, software image processing plays a huge role in producing the final image we see, and Google's is so good that the Pixel 7a's photos look better than the camera hardware would suggest. And as I already teased earlier, the Pixel 7a's photos can go toe to toe with the Pixel 7 in many instances, despite the latter having better hardware. The samples below include photos snapped by the Pixel 7a, followed by a shot snapped by the Pixel 7 or 7 Pro (they have identical main camera hardware).

Most of these shots were taken against backlight on purpose because I wanted to test the cameras in challenging conditions, and we can see the 7a images look very good. In the third set, the 7a's dynamic range isn't as wide as the Pixel 7's but otherwise, the other images are very close in quality. If you zoom into the photos 100% and pixel peep, you can see the Pixel 7a's photos are softer on details than the Pixel 7/7 Pro's, but this is minor.

The magic lies with the Tensor G2 chip, which was designed to handle Google's AI tasks including and especially image processing, and we can see the Tensor really working wonders to help the relatively weak Pixel 7a camera hardware keep up with the stronger Pixel 7 camera hardware.

However, software processing can only do so much. If I take photos with several objects/subjects, located at varying distances to the camera, you can see that the Pixel 7's larger sensor with shallower depth-of-field produces stronger natural bokeh. The Pixel 7a's images, without the bokeh, look flat by comparison. The difference is more jarring when you compare the Pixel 7a's shot against the Sony IMX989 1-inch sensor (the largest sensor in mobile cameras right now).

Natural bokeh from large sensors doesn't result in just a simple "background blur," it also compresses the background a bit, giving it a feeling of separation. Pay attention to the plant immediately behind the number 7 sign: The Pixel 7's image shows a better separation between the plant and the sign than the 7a's image.

Enough camera nerd nitpicking. The Pixel 7a's main camera is still the overall best at its price range because it has a responsive shutter, is fast to focus, and can find proper balance in challenging lighting conditions. Below are more main camera samples I've snapped over the week of using the Pixel 7a. This camera will satisfy most people.

The Pixel 7a's ultrawide camera, a 13MP f/2.2 shooter, is very good during the day, capturing sweeping imagery with excellent dynamic range and no noticeable distortion, but at night suffers from the same problem most ultrawide cameras face. They produce very soft details and are in need of a two-second night mode. This isn't so much a Pixel 7a problem, as most ultrawide cameras have trouble in low-light situations. There are only a small handful of exceptions — most notably the Oppo Find X6 Pro — and they're in phones that cost well over four digits.

The Pixel 7a does not have a dedicated zoom lens, but it uses an in-sensor crop to produce a 2X zoom that is a bit better than a typical digital zoom. In a vacuum, 2X shots by the Pixel 7a are quite good, though the zoom shots lack the natural bokeh/background compression that comes from shooting with a real telephoto lens.

You can push digital zoom up to 8X, but images here are clearly noisy and soft on details.

Video performance is good for the price, with OIS and EIS doing the work to stabilize walking footage, and the Tensor G2 working its magic to minimize wind noise and find exposure in real-time.

Performance: No complaints in this price range

While the Tensor G2 is extremely intelligent and brings so many smart features to the table, I must point out that it is not as technically powerful as Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, or even the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 for that matter. The Tensor G2's GPU and CPU are slower and less capable, and I notice many day-to-day tasks, like trimming the length of a video via the phone's default video editor, take longer on any Pixel 7 phone than on any flagship Samsung/OnePlus/Xiaomi device. When it comes to gaming, the Arm Mali-G710 MC7 of the Tensor G2 can handle light gaming fine, but if you're a heavy gamer playing for hours at a time, the Tensor G2 will heat up faster and thus throttle performance more so than the last two Qualcomm flagship chips.

While the Tensor G2's lack of raw power compared to the best Qualcomm chips could be used as a knock against the flagship Pixel 7 Pro, I don't think that criticism is justified here with the $499 Pixel 7a. If you're using the phone like the average person — scrolling through social media, streaming videos and music, taking photos, and texting — the Pixel 7a is more than powerful enough to handle all of those needs.

Battery life has been good for the Pixel 7a, with the 4,385mAh cell able to last the entire day every day over my 8-day review period. The abysmally slow charging is annoying, but with a bit of planning ahead, it shouldn't be an issue. Speaker quality, cell reception, and haptics are all satisfactory and can be considered good in the $499 price range as well.

Software: It's Android the way Google envisioned it

As a Pixel phone, the 7a has the luxury of running the latest version of Android the way Google envisions it. Android 13 ships out of the box, but whenever Android 14 hits, this phone will be among the first to get it. The software experience is virtually identical to the Pixel 7/7 Pro, so expect a colorful UI with flashy animations and a myriad of smart features.

It's the latter that makes Google phones such a joy to use. For example, I love the Pixel's ability to automatically identify music playing near me and display artist's name and track title on the always-on display. I also find Google's At A Glance homescreen widget to be very useful since it can display contextual information, such as upcoming appointments or flight information. Of course, the widget can show you this information on its own because it's scouring your Gmail or Google Calendar, so some may not be comfortable giving an app this much access. But I'm OK with it.

Another absolutely game-changing Pixel exclusive feature is the scary good voice dictation. Recent Pixel phones can transcribe human voices in real-time, at almost the same pace as speech, and at nearly 99% accuracy. This works in the Pixel's native voice recorder app, or when using voice to type. The Pixel's voice typing is so good that it changes how I use the phone. When I'm on a Pixel, I use my voice to type chat messages regularly. I wouldn't do this with basically any other phone because it's nowhere near as accurate.

There's also Direct My Call, which came in very handy recently when I had to call a debt collection agency for my mother who had an unpaid parking ticket. Google had the agency's automated system in its database, and as soon as my call connected, not only did the Pixel 7a transcribe exactly what the automated call service said, but the Pixel 7a also mapped out the various options I can select, giving me a quicker route to speak to a customer service agent.

As I wrote in my Pixel 7 review, the Pixel is the smartest smartphone, and that holds true with the Pixel 7a.

Should you buy the Google Pixel 7a?

You should buy the Google Pixel 7a if:

You want a new phone under $500 and camera performance a high priority   You want an Android phone that's easy to use, with a great price-to-performance ratio   You want a phone that's easy to use with one hand

You should not buy the Google Pixel 7a if:

You don't mind paying another $200 for the Pixel 7 Pro   You live in regions where Poco sells phones, and you care about display quality and raw processing power

At $499, the Pixel 7a is an easy recommendation in the midrange space. It has a better camera, more intelligent software, and a more capable chip than the Samsung Galaxy A54. The most recent iPhone SE (released in 2022) looks hilariously outdated with the thick bezels and LCD screen.

However, there are some caveats. The Pixel 7 officially retails for $599, but I've seen it on sale for around $550. If there's only a $50 difference between the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7a, then perhaps the former is still the better option because it has more premium construction and a slightly better camera.

Also, if you live in regions where Xiaomi's Poco sub-brand sells phones, the also just-released Poco F5 Pro starts at $449 and offers a WQHD+ 120Hz display with Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1. While the Pixel 7a still has it beat in camera performance and software, the Poco F5 Pro has a better display and processor in a lower-priced package with a charger and phone case included.

Personally, I'd take the Pixel 7a over both the Galaxy A54 or the Poco F5 Pro because the main camera and software smarts make the difference.

Google's latest mid-ranger brings several improvements over last year's model, making it a great option for the budget conscious. The Pixel 7a packs the flagship Tensor G2 chip, flagship-tier cameras, an improved 90Hz display, more RAM, better durability, and wireless charging support.

Q: What colors are the Google Pixel 7a available in?

The Google Pixel 7a comes in four colors: Charcoal (black), Snow (white), Sea (blue), and Coral (orange). However, Coral is a Google store exclusive, meaning you must purchase from Google's website to get that color. The other three will be widely available across carriers and retailers like Amazon.

Q: Does the Google Pixel 7a have a SIM card slot? Does it have eSIM?

The Google Pixel 7a has a slot for a single physical SIM, and it also supports eSIM. You can run dual SIMs via one physical SIM and one eSIM, or both eSIM. Check out XDA's guide on how to set up and use eSIMs to learn more.

Q: How fast does the Google Pixel 7a charge?

The Google Pixel 7a charges at 20W speeds. However, the phone does not include a charger, so you will have to use a charger that can output at least 20W of power with USB-C PD support to charge the Pixel 7a at its maximum speed.

Q: Does the Google Pixel 7a have expandable memory?

The Google Pixel 7a does not have expandable memory. What's more, the phone only comes in one configuration with 128GB storage. After accounting for storage space the core software will take, you're left with about 100GB. Google is likely banking on consumers using cloud storage, and luckily, Google does have one of the best cloud service systems around.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7A Review - Pros and cons, Verdict

Text: Whilst talking about smartphone brands in the high-end flagship segment, Google’s name only finds a mention after the likes of Samsung and Apple. However, the Mountain View-based tech giant’s A-series phones, which are relatively more affordable, have gained significant attention, especially in India. I have with me the Google Pixel 7a, a successor to last year’s popular Pixel 6a (review).

A cursory glance at the spec sheet shows that the Pixel 7a is not all that different from the regular Pixel 7 (review). However, the new A series phone carries a sticker price of Rs 43,999, which is lower than what the Pixel 7 is currently retailing for. In this review, let’s find out if the Pixel 7a can be your daily driver and how different it as as compared to the regular Pixel 7.

The differences between the Pixel 7a and Pixel 7 are minor and may not significantly affect the overall smartphone experience. The Pixel 7a offers all the core features of a Pixel phone such as excellent image processing and AI-based features, while costing less. It may be a good choice for those interested in Google’s premium smartphone experience, but not for those who covet powerful processing capabilities or fast charging speeds.

The Pixel 7a’s build quality doesn’t feel too different from the Pixel 7. It has a back panel with a glossy finish and matte-finished aluminum rails, similar to the Pixel 7 although the construction is plastic instead of glass. In fact, as far as dimensions go, there is basically no difference between the two. Even the camera visor on the back stretches from one end to the other, has a metallic finish, and houses two camera sensors along with a flash. Two of the three colour variants on the Pixel 7a, Charcoal and Snow, can also be found on the handset’s older sibling. It would be easy to mistake one phone for the other even for a seasoned smartphone enthusiast such as myself. In terms of protection, the Pixel 7a has an IP67 rating, as against the Pixel 7 which boasts a rating of IP68.

The Pixel 7a fits seamlessly between a small-sized mobile device and a larger phablet-style smartphone. Given its pocketable proportions, the handset slides easily into the pocket and doesn’t feel cumbersome to use with one hand. Google’s branding is prominently in the centre with a small ‘Made in Vietnam’ inscription at the bottom. The phone makes use of a dual-speaker setup with the earpiece doubling up for stereo output. Merely holding the phone gives an impression of luxury, and its appearance sets it apart from other smartphones, conveying a sense of uniqueness.

Display-wise the device has a 6.1-inch FHD+ panel of the OLED variety that can refresh at 90Hz. However, unlike the regular Pixel 7’s Corning Gorilla Glass Victus protection, the 7a only has Gorilla Glass 3. Apart from that, the viewing metrics of the 7a remain identical to the Pixel 7. Things like browsing the web, scrolling through social media, and watching YouTube, have nearly the same visual appeal.

While the 7a does have HDR10 playback on OTT platforms like Netflix, I did find the dynamic range remained a bit lacking as compared to some other phones in the segment. However, again this is just mostly nitpicking as most users are likely to appreciate the 7a’s visual clarity, vibrant colours, and high contrast ratios. Google has not specified the brightness levels of the handset but my usage was unhindered outdoors. Finally, the phone does have a punch-hole up top for the selfie shooter, but the bezels that surround the panel are unapologetically large, especially the chin.

If the Pixel phones are known most for anything, it is their image-taking prowess. While not harbouring the most impressive of camera hardware, Google’s background computational algorithms enhance the final shot to an extreme degree. The same is true for the Pixel 7a which has a 64MP primary shooter (higher resolution than the Pixel 7’s 50MP snapper) and a 13MP ultra-wide sensor. Again, it matters not what sensor is crammed into the back of the 7a. The final result, after having gone through Google’s AI wizardry, is what we are here for and boy does the handset deliver.

Talking first about daylight photography, the Pixel 7a manages to snap highly detailed images with rich and vibrant colours. I was particularly impressed at how well the Tensor G2 adjusts the dynamic range and exposure levels in its post-processing. Of course, each image goes through the same fine-tuning process which takes a few seconds and is not instantly available for preview after being clicked. However, the output is almost always well worth this wait. The sensor’s ability to shoot 64MP images is just marketing speak to get pixel-binned 16MP shots which benefit in detailing by combining four pixels into one. Long story short, the Pixel 7a shoots remarkably reliable, realistic, and dynamically rich snaps that are akin to the handset’s more expensive sibling.

Apart from the phone’s great point-and-shoot experience, the Pixel 7a has other camera tricks up its sleeve. While there is no telephoto sensor, the handset can still capture shots at 2X zoom with little to no hit on the details or colours. There’s the Long Exposure mode which works as advertised with a tasteful blur of fast-moving objects in the background while the subject remains perfectly in focus.

The portrait mode images are done just as well in terms of edge detection. However, these bokeh-style snaps only work with human subjects. Google is also claiming realistic skin tones with a Real Tone functionality baked into its image processing pipeline. I personally felt that the Pixel 7a slightly overprocessed darker skin tones but overall the effect is pleasing. Finally, there is the ultra wide-angle 13MP shooter which does a stellar job of spreading focus across the frame while also not warping the image at the edges.

The low-light photography on the device is equally impressive, to say the least. In conditions with some amount of ambient lighting, the photos that are churned out have ample detail. Noise levels in the night sky are smoothened out in a way that the landscape below remains unblemished. The Pixel 7a is also capable of capturing images that reveal more details than what is visible to the naked eye, even in extremely low lighting conditions. As for the selfies, the images from the front-facing camera are nothing out of the ordinary in terms of background lighting and skin tones. However, the sensor does capture a healthy amount of facial detail. Overall, from my time with the phone, it is clear that if you are a casual smartphone photography enthusiast, then the Pixel 7a will not disappoint.

The smartphone is powered by the same custom Tensor G2 SoC that Google introduced on its flagship Pixel 7 lineup. By no means is the device a performance fiend and I think the company does not intend it to be as well. However, the G2 is tuned to optimise the background machine learning and computational chops that Pixel phones have become so adept at in recent times.

The Pixel 7a will not find the best refuge in benchmark numbers. Geekbench 5 outright refused to download or sideload on the device. Antutu V9 returned a score of 717,397 and on the CPU Throttle test the device maintained just 58 percent of its peak performance. Heavy-duty gaming is also not the best with the phone’s graphical output being limited. CoD: Mobile did run on 60fps for about 60 minutes but the phone started getting unreasonably hot after that, leading to frame drops.

However, for my everyday usage, task like accessing Google’s suite of apps, social media browsing, viewing OTT content, and in general just switching between multiple apps, posed little to no problems. The phone does have 8GB of fast LPDDR5 RAM which helps in this regard along with 128GB UFS 3.1 of storage. Unfortunately, there is no way to expand the latter since there’s no microSD card slot. Google does offer 100GB of cloud storage with the Pixel 7a but it will be free only for the first three months.

The phone does have 5G connectivity, but only for sub-6GHz channels. I used the phone on Jio’s Noida circle without any issues of call drops or poor data speeds. Apart from that the phone has a decent-sounding stereo speaker setup although I feel that the volume levels could do with an increase. Authentication-wise the phone uses an in-display fingerprint reader of the optical variety and also a facial recognition system.

Software is also an important aspect of the Pixel experience and the 7a packs in everything Google has to offer. The device, of course, ships with Android 13 out of the box, in the typical clean and stock style that Google offers. The only default apps you will find pre-installed are the ones made by the company. Google also is providing five years of security updates on the phone, which is a year more than what Samsung offers on its flagship devices.

The meat of Google’s capabilities is in the tools it provides for a better user experience than almost any Android phone on the market. This includes the phone’s ability to transcribe conversations seamlessly. The Pixel 7a even recognises different voices and labels the dialogue accordingly. For the time being, this feature works only with US English. I also tried the Clear Calling toggle, which uses AI to remove any background interference at the receiver’s end. The difference was noticeable with the feature turned on but not as significant as I had expected. Google Assistant shines brightly on the Pixel 7a and lends a helping hand with things like At a Glance, which puts your reminders, events, flight schedule, etc on the home screen automatically for easier visibility. There is also the unblur feature that does a satisfactory job of bringing shaky photos back in focus.

The Pixel 7a actually has about the same battery capacity as the Pixel 7 at 4,385mAh but it charges just a bit slower at 18W. In terms of the overall battery life, the 7a lasts about six hours on a full charge, which I find more than acceptable for its size. Of course, this doesn’t entail any extreme GPU activity, which is likely to drain the battery rapidly. Juicing up the phone takes some time, two hours to be exact, and when you see competitor handsets topping up in less than 30 minutes, the Pixel 7a’s charging can feel quite slow. However, I do appreciate the Pixel 7a including wireless charging, a feature which lacks in this price range.

If there’s one thing that has become abundantly clear it’s that the Pixel 7a is not that different from the regular Pixel 7. Differences lie only in the screen protection upfront, the resolution of the images snapped, the IP rating, and the lack of a 256GB storage variant. I feel that for most users such differences can become negligible when talking about the smartphone experience as a whole.

Both the Pixel 7a and Pixel 7 share the fundamental aspects of a Pixel phone, including outstanding image processing, AI-driven features, a lively display, and decent battery life. While the Pixel 7 is currently priced at Rs 49,999 on Flipkart, the Pixel 7a is available at a more affordable price of Rs 43,999, making it an attractive option for those seeking a top-notch smartphone experience from Google.

Of course, the Pixel 7a misses out on powerful processing capabilities, and its charging speeds are none too great compared to other contemporaries like the OnePlus 11R. All things considered, if you are in the market for quality point-and-shoot photography and a superlative Android experience, then the Pixel 7a would be the way to go.

Text: There’s been a healthy buzz around the Google Pixel 7A, and as a long-time tech enthusiast, I was eager to get my hands on it. Having spent a couple of weeks with the device, I am now ready to share my thoughts. Spoiler alert: it’s largely positive.

To address the elephant in the room, yes, the Google Pixel 7A is released and available as of May 10, 2023. And the question “Is Google Pixel 7A worth buying?” is a resounding yes.

The first impression the Pixel 7A makes is its form factor. Sporting a dimension of 152 x 72.9 x 9 mm, this phone’s size falls into the comfortable sweet spot between compact and too big. It fits comfortably in my pocket and is effortless to operate with one hand. Moreover, with a weight of 193.5g, it has a reassuring heft to it, thanks to the aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass 3 front.

The display is a vibrant 6.1 inch OLED screen offering a resolution of 1080 x 2400 pixels. With the 90Hz refresh rate, scrolling through apps and websites is silky smooth. This is a feature usually seen in high-end devices, so having it in the Pixel 7A definitely elevates the user experience.

With the Google Tensor G2 chipset and 8GB RAM, this device delivers excellent performance. Navigating the UI, switching between apps, and gaming were all buttery smooth, with no noticeable lags or stutters. Internal storage is a solid 128GB, ample for my needs.

As for the camera, Google continues its tradition of providing top-notch camera capabilities even in its mid-range devices. The dual main camera setup (64MP and 13MP ultrawide) delivers brilliant photos with excellent detail and vibrant colors. The ultrawide camera managed high contrast scenes impressively, and the 13MP selfie camera produced some excellent shots. The camera’s low-light mode was exceptional, managing to turn almost pitch-dark scenes into day-lit photos. For video, the 4K capture is clear and stable.

In terms of battery, the Pixel 7A comes with a 4385mAh power unit. With moderate use, the phone lasted me for about 34 hours. While this isn’t industry-leading, it’s a solid offering for a mid-range phone. I do wish the charging was a bit faster though, as it took me about 1 hour 45 minutes to fully charge the battery with an 18W charger.

Software-wise, the phone comes with Android 13, which in typical Google style, is optimized, efficient, and full of useful features. What I appreciate most about Google’s approach to software is its commitment to long-term support, with at least five years of software and security updates guaranteed.

The Pixel 7A does seem to have a slight edge over the Pixel 7. While it’s slightly smaller and the back is made of high-quality recycled plastic instead of glass, it matches the Pixel 7 in terms of performance and even camera capabilities. Considering that it’s £150 cheaper, I’d say it offers better value for money.

There are a few drawbacks. The absence of a 3.5mm headphone jack might be a deal-breaker for some. Also, the lack of a microSD slot could be a disadvantage for users who need more than the provided 128GB storage. Lastly, while the face unlock is a welcome addition, it’s not as secure as other rivals in the market.

But, none of these are deal-breakers, in my opinion.

The Google Pixel 7A is a well-rounded device that delivers high-end features for a reasonable price. It’s an ideal phone for someone looking for flagship features without breaking the bank.

One of the greatest strengths of the Pixel 7A lies in its camera. In this price range, you would be hard-pressed to find a smartphone with better camera performance. It doesn’t just outdo its mid-range competitors; it goes toe-to-toe with some high-end devices.

Another major win for the Pixel 7A is its promise of long-term software support. A guaranteed five years of updates gives you the assurance that your device won’t become outdated too soon. And with Google’s thoughtful inclusion of both face and fingerprint unlock, there’s added flexibility in how you secure your device.

The plastic back might not be as premium as the glass on its more expensive siblings, but it’s durable and does the job well. Besides, most of us will be putting a case on it anyway.

The Pixel 7A’s battery is robust enough for a solid day’s work, although it falls short of the top performers in this regard. But this is more than compensated for by the device’s other strengths.

In the end, the Google Pixel 7A offers fantastic value for money. It offers an impressive list of features and performance stats that are mostly found in high-end phones, but at a more affordable price. Comparing it to the Pixel 7, I’d argue that it delivers an almost identical user experience for a significantly lesser price. It’s a no-brainer, the Pixel 7A is indeed worth buying.

Taking everything into account, I would rate the Google Pixel 7A a solid 8.5 out of 10.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a: Everything you need to know

Text: Google has finally complete the Pixel 7 line-up with the cheapest model in the series: the Google Pixel 7a.

With the same chipset as its big brothers, plus an upgraded camera and the introduction of wireless charging, the Pixel 7a could be exceptionally competitive in the mid-range market this year, and might be one of the best value phones around.

Here’s what you need to know about the phone that could be the benchmark for mid-range Android phones in 2023 – or go ahead and read our Pixel 7a review to find out what we think of it.

The Pixel 7a launched at Google’s annual I/O conference on 10 May, and the company is making the phone available to buy from the official Google Store immediately, though it may take a little longer for the phone to arrive at other retailers.

The Pixel 7a only comes in one version, keeping the pricing simple. It costs $499/£449/€509. (Available now from Google).

That’s an increase from the $449/£399/€459 Pixel 6a, though between current inflation and some of the phone’s upgraded features, that increase doesn’t seem too unreasonable.

Just as importantly, it’s still a decent amount cheaper than the $599/£599/€649 Pixel 7, representing real value for money.

Much like last year’s 6a, the Pixel 7a is impressively similar to the standard Pixel 7, sharing some of its best features – though there are differences that explain the price gap.

First up, the 7a is a little smaller. It’s 6.1in display isn’t as big as the 7’s 6.3in panel, and as a result the phone as a whole is a little lighter – though only by 4g. It’s not as slim as the Pixel 7, at 9mm thick, but overall still feels fairly svelte and compact.

The design is otherwise similar to the other Pixel 7 phones though, with a matching camera bar across the back, though this sticks out a little less here. The phone comes in a choice of four colours: Charcoal, Snow, and Sea will be widely available, but the bright Coral is a Google Store exclusive.

Impressively, the 7a also has an IP67 rating, meaning it’s fairly safe from dust and water damage.

The screen itself is an OLED panel with a Full HD+ resolution and a 90Hz refresh rate. That’s now the same as the regular 7, though in fairness it does lag behind the competition: smoother 120Hz screens are now the standard across other mid-range phones, though for most people the difference is relatively minor.

The display includes a fingerprint sensor, but also the selfie camera that allows you to use face unlock. That might not seem remarkable, but previous Pixel a phones have omitted the tech (as, indeed, have some of the flagships). It returned in the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro though, and now looks to be part of the 7a too.

The phone is meanwhile powered by the Tensor G2, Google’s own in-house chipset that’s also found in both the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro. In those phones it’s arguably a little underpowered compared to other flagship options, but in the 7a it should offer the perfect amount of power to compete with mid-range rivals.

To keep things simple, it only comes in one version: with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.

The camera has had some upgrades too, with a new 64Mp main camera, alongside a 13Mp ultrawide and 13Mp selfie camera. These aren’t the same cameras found in the other Pixel 7 phones, so it’s likely that the 7a will lag behind them in quality a little, but every lens is higher resolution than the Pixel 6a equivalents, so this should be an upgrade on last year.

One definite upgrade is the inclusion of wireless charging – a first for a Pixel a. It’s only at slow-ish 7.5W speeds, but most standard wireless chargers don’t go a lot faster than that anyway. The phone also supports 18W wired charging over USB-C, but remember that Google doesn’t include a charger in the box.

As for the battery itself, the 4385mAh cell isn’t the biggest around, but is likely enough to last the day.

Finally, software. It won’t surprise you to hear that the Google phone will launch with Android 13, the latest version of the operating system. It will also get the same update promise as Google’s premium phones, with three major OS updates (so through to Android 16) plus five years of security patches in total.

Here are the full specs:

Text: The Pixel 7a is the best $749 you can spend on an Android phone

Google's latest cheap Pixel phone reclaims the crown in the mid-range market.

If you're going to buy any Google phone in 2023, it should probably be the Pixel 7a. It's substantially cheaper than its flagship counterparts and comes with an almost identical set of bells, whistles and AI-enhanced smarts.

The phrase "flagship features at half the price" gets thrown around a lot these days, but last year's Pixel 6a was the closest it felt like Google has gotten to turning it from a slogan into something more substantial.

From as far back as its first iteration, the Google Pixel A series has always been something of an anti-flagship. The Pixel 7a takes that idea even further. If 2022's A-series device posed the question of whether it was still worth it to up-sell yourself to the Pixel 6 at all, this year's follow-up walks in with a more definitive answer.

How much does Google Pixel 7a cost in Australia?

In Australia, the Google Pixel 7a starts at $749 and is available outright on a plan through select mobile carriers. Here's how that pricing compares to past A-series handsets:

The short version is the story here is that the Google Pixel 7a has the exact same launch price as last year's Google Pixel 6a. Price-wise, it sits just above the Galaxy A54 5G and just below the Nokia X30 5G.

If you're looking to pick up the Google Pixel 7a outright, check out the list of retailers below.

See it at GoogleSee it at TelstraSee it at JB Hi-FiSee it at Harvey NormanSee it at OfficeworksThe Google Pixel 7a is also available on a plan through Telstra and Optus.

At the time of writing, the cheapest Google Pixel 7a plan in Australia is the $49 Optus Choice Plus Plan. That plan nets you 5G connectivity, unlimited calls and text and 30GB of monthly data. On a 36-month plan, that plan totals $69.80 per month with handset repayments factored in.

To see how this plan compares to the other options available for the Pixel 7a, check out the widget below.

The budget phone that's built better

The Google Pixel 7a doesn't look like a huge departure from the Pixel 6a. That's partially a function of the similarities between the Pixel 6 and Pixel 7. But then again, the A-Series has never been the most experimental branch of Google's foray into the phone market. Why settle for goofy gimmicks or half-measures when you can just have it all?

When it comes to colours, Aussies have three tones to choose between: Sea (Blue), Charcoal (Grey) and Snow (White). The material design and build quality here aren't quite as glamorous as something more high-end, but it's a real standout when it comes to phones around this price point.

The Pixel 7a is a cheap phone that doesn't feel like it. What's more, it's a comparatively small phone to hold and handle. There are many other mid-rangers out there with an OLED display like the one found here, but a scant few of them are 6.1 inches in size. If you're the kind of person who loathes the trend towards larger screens, the Pixel 7a might be the device you've been waiting for.

Despite the nimble and compact size, the Pixel 7a comes loaded with more flagship features than ever before. You've got the usual inclusions like an in-display fingerprint sensor, IP68 water resistance, a 90Hz refresh rate, stereo speakers and (for the first time) wireless charging.

It doesn't have the triple-lens camera, reverse wireless charging, additional RAM or QHD resolution seen in the Pixel 7 Pro, but it's a match for last year's standard model in all the ways that matter. In some cases, the specs of the Pixel 7a are actually better than the Pixel 7. For instance, it's got a slightly larger battery and a camera system with more megapixels.

Speaking of, the rear-facing half of the Pixel 7a features a bar-shaped camera bump analogous to the one found on its 2022 counterpart. The lenses have been shuffled around, but the hardware holds its own.

Held up against last year's Pixel 6a, Google has traded up from 12MP on the main lens to a 64MP sensor. The wide-angle lens that complements the primary one is also getting bumped up to 13MP from 12MP. While those numbers don't tell the whole story, there's a case to be made that this upgrade puts Google's latest A-Series device right behind the Pixel 7 Pro when it comes to the capabilities of its camera.

After about two weeks of messing with it, I came away more than just satisfied with what the Pixel 7a's rear camera could do. As with other Pixel phones, it often feels like Google is casting a spell on the images you capture.

In almost every situation, and especially in those where you'd expect a phone of this price point to struggle, the Pixel 7a delivered results that I actively wanted to share on social media.

The Magic Eraser built into the Google Photos editor is hardly new at this point, but it should be mentioned in light of the upgraded take on the feature that Google showed off at its most recent I/O conference. It's one thing to have a phone that can take nice photos. It's another to have one that can help you fix bad ones. Scrubbing unwanted details out of an otherwise perfect shot without having to leave your camera is a small change that yields a big difference here.

Features like these are not just helping teach less tech-literate users to do things they would otherwise do in Photoshop in a more intuitive and accessible way. It is fascinating to think about what the long-tail and second-order effects of making that kind of image manipulation more democratised and accessible might look like. Right now though,

In any case and regardless of which lens or camera mode I used, the Pixel 7a proved itself capable of delivering impressive shots and reliable results. Check out the gallery below for a sense of what it can do.

As with the camera, a lot of what's here when it comes to performance is a clear improvement on last year's Google Pixel 6a.

There's only one model of the Pixel 7a available, but it comes with the Google Tensor G2 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard storage. That last one aside, the specs here are a tangible upgrade on those of the previous model.

This spec bump is easy to get excited about, but the results are rarely surprising. The story here is a bit of a rehash of that of the previous A-Series device. The second-generation Tensor processor isn't quite capable of outperforming the likes of Apple's A15 Bionic, but it's miles ahead of anything else you'll find at this price point.

Apps loaded fast, multitasking was a breeze and graphically demanding games like Honkai Star Rail ran well on the Pixel 7a. All told Google's latest budget-friendly handset isn't exactly going to break speed records when it comes to performance, but it's more than fast enough on most fronts. This is not a phone built for edge cases so much as it is for everyday use.

The battery life supports this in strong form. There's a 4388mAh battery inside the Pixel 7a. I found that I'd usually end up getting about two days off a single charge, landing at around 60% battery remaining at the end of the first. Throw in the convenience of both wireless and fast charging, and there's little to complain about here.

It doesn't reach the 3-day highs that some budget and mid-range phones offer, but it's hard to imagine finding anything with better battery performance and as many bells and whistles as the Pixel 7a.

Most of the features, a fraction of the price.

This year's Google Pixel 7a makes it extremely difficult to recommend last year's Pixel 7. It's got almost all the same features and a much more attractive price point. While the two devices do differ slightly in terms of overall built quality, the only major things you're missing out on if you opt for the cheaper one are a larger screen and reverse wireless charging.

If a 6.1-inch display sounds like it might be a little cramped for your liking, the Pixel 7 is going to be the right way to go. However, for everyone else, the Pixel 7a is likely going to be the better value buy.

The Google Pixel 7a is Google's best affordable flagship since its first one. With a cutting-edge processor, capable camera, distinct design and better-than-bearable battery life, it's a phone that ticks all the boxes at an incredibly competitive price.

There are reasons to consider the alternatives, but it's indicative of just how good the Pixel 7a is that it's easier to list the short list of reasons to strike it out than it is to roll out the red carpet for all the reasons that it rules. After the way that past A-Series devices shook up the mid-range market, I can't wait to see what this one does to the flagship end of things.

If you feel like giving in to astonishment, then it's safe to say that the Google Pixel 7a is pretty much the best deal in Android phones right now.

Softtitle: Pixel 7a Review: Practically Perfect
Publisher: Twenty First Tech
Author: Editor
Date: 2023-05-16T14:55:37.000Z
Text: Let’s start with the conclusion. The Pixel 7a is a well-rounded smartphone with good performance and great cameras but disappointingly average battery life. It is so similar to the Pixel 7 that if either of the two phones go on sale, my advice would be to just get the one that’s cheaper. If you’re looking for a no-nonsense phone that does everything you expect it to do for a reasonable price, the Pixel 7a should be high on your list.

What’s the difference from the Pixel 7?

They are practically the same phone. The differences, listed below, are minor in my opinion.

There are some other minor differences. The bezels on the 7a are slightly thicker. The back is made of plastic instead of glass. And the camera visor has a noticeable seam where it meets the frame of the phone, unlike the Pixel 7 which is one seamless piece. But these are so minor that I didn’t notice, and you likely won’t either.

. These are the reasons for which you would want to buy a Pixel. The clean software. Excellent cameras. Useful AI features like Magic Eraser, Live Captions, Live Translate, and Now Playing. Being first in line for Android updates (but please Google, extend software support from 3 years to 4-5 years at least).

. Google has stuck with the iconic visor design for 2 years now, and it’s starting to grow on me. It’s a nice implementation of the classic two-tone design that Google phones have been known for for years. The camera bump on the Pixel 7a is much less pronounced than that on the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro. And every person who saw my review unit’s new Sea colour gushed over it; it really does look nice.

. Unlike last year, Google has matched the amount of RAM that the regular Pixel 7 has — 8GB. And thanks to this, the 7a has fewer issues with multitasking than the Pixel 6a before it. The processor is also matched, though the Tensor G2 isn’t anything to write home about compared to the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, both in terms of performance and efficiency. Peak performance is on par with the Tensor G1 from the year before, which is just ~15% higher than the Snapdragon 888 from 2 years ago. That said, sustained performance saw significant improvements from the Tensor G1, ~50% higher. I’ve found it to provide snappy and smooth performance for everyday use. 3D games such as Laya’s Horizon also ran well enough, typically maintaining 30fps during short gameplay sessions, though I did notice frame dips in busier sections. If you game very frequently for long periods of time, you might want to go for something more powerful.

. Again, unlike last year, the Pixel 7a now has a smooth 90Hz screen, which is the bare minimum that I’ll accept these days. Strangely, however, this is disabled by default, and you’ll have to toggle it on in the settings.

. As expected from a Pixel, they’re fantastic. Accurate colours, good dynamic range, and an unrivalled night mode for both main and ultrawide cameras. But just like the Pixel 7, it lacks a telephoto camera; if you need this badly, consider getting the Pixel 7 Pro, which has an unbelievably good telephoto camera. Also, I don’t take video, but if you do, apparently video stabilisation isn’t as good as the Pixel 7. In terms of video quality, Google in general still has some catching up to do with Apple’s iPhones.

. I was going to do my usual rant about how I hate the glass sandwich build that the Pixel 7a and every other modern smartphone has — it’s too heavy, it’s fragile, it’s slippery etc. But then I found out that the Pixel 7a’s back isn’t even made of glass; it’s plastic. And that just made me angrier — how can it be plastic and still weigh a whopping 193.5g? The 7a is way too heavy for its size and significantly heavier than the 178g Pixel 6a, which I already found too heavy. The weight annoys me to the point where I want to use the phone less. Google, please make lighter phones. Go back to the design of the Pixel 5, because that phone was perfect.

. Battery life is painfully average. I frequently get ~20% battery at the end of the day on this brand new Pixel 7a, and my usage is moderate at worst with just ~3h screen on time. It gives me little confidence that the battery will last me a full day after a year of use. The charging speeds aren’t great either, particularly for wireless charging.

The Pixel 7a launched for $499 in the US — that’s $50 more than the Pixel 6a before it. But in Singapore, the Pixel 7a launches for the same S$749 that the Pixel 6a launched for. And that’s a pretty great deal, but I suspect it will get even better.

The Pixel 6a was regularly discounted to just S$499 shortly after its launch. That’s an absolute steal. And I suspect the same thing will happen to the Pixel 7a. So if you’re not in a hurry, do keep a lookout for a price drop. If it the Pixel 7a hits S$600 or less, it’s an absolute no-brainer.

As for me, I’m still holding on to my Pixel 5. And I will continue to do so until Google makes a phone of similar size and weight again. But hey, that’s just me. If the size and weight of the Pixel 7a doesn’t bother you, then get it — other than the average battery, it’s practically perfect.

You can get the Pixel 7a from Google Singapore’s official store or any of its partners. If you’re thinking of getting one now, be sure to take advantage of the launch promotions which are running till 22 May.

As always, when purchasing online, check if you can get additional cashback on your purchase with ShopBack. You can also check out our deals page for more Singapore deals.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a stars in hands-on leak with smaller battery than Pixel 6a
Publisher: Notebookcheck
Author: Alex Alderson
Date: 2023-05-04T00:00:00.000Z
Text: The Pixel 7a may still be a few days away from its expected launch, but someone has managed to get their hands on one of the first units. While a prototype unit briefly re-emerged on eBay last month, it appears that YouTuber Munchy has obtained a retail unit, denoted by the 'PRODUCTION' flag that Fastboot Mode reports. In comparison, Pixel 7a prototypes returned 'DEVELOPMENT' next to their Secure boot entry.

Not only has Munchy shared previously unknown hardware details about the Pixel 7a, but he has also published a lengthy hands-on with the device. Allegedly, the device is the Pixel 7a's Arctic Blue variant, although it looks more like Snow in most lighting conditions. As other leaks have shown, the Pixel 7a has a 90 Hz display, a Google Tensor G2 chipset, 8 GB LPDDR5 RAM and supports wireless charging, all firsts for the Pixel A-Series.

However, Munchy adds that the Pixel 7a is much closer to the Pixel 7 in weight than its direct predecessor. Specifically, the Pixel 7a weighs 193 g, 4 g shy of the Pixel 7 but 25 g heavier than the Pixel 6a. Surprisingly, the increase in weight relative to the Pixel 6a does not yield a larger battery capacity. Instead, Munchy reports that the Pixel 7a has a 4,300 mAh battery, which Device Info HW screenshots support. Google will announce the Pixel 7a on May 10 alongside at least the Pixel Fold. European and UK pricing has now leaked too, as has the price of the device's official cases.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a Review: Pixel 7, Meet Your Replacement
Publisher: Droid Life
Author: Kellen

Text: Unlike most in this space, the Pixel 6a did not win me over last year. While Google’s A-Series phone took on the new Pixel design and brought with it a solid set of specs for an OK-at-launch price, I had a couple of complaints that made it a phone not to consider. The 60Hz refresh rate in the display was a cheap decision from Google, the battery life had me worried, and the camera didn’t give me that Pixel confidence.

For the Pixel 7a, Google appears to have addressed those three concerns, at least on paper. We got a 90Hz refresh rate, battery life that could see improvement through a new processor, and a brand new camera system. Thankfully, Google sent me a 7a to review and I’ve had a solid couple of weeks with it to tell you if they really did fix the problems from the 6a. Is this the new Pixel to buy? With a price increase to keep in mind, let’s talk about it.

This is our Pixel 7a review.

Design. You either love the Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 design, with Google’s new signature camera bar, or you don’t. That’s fine. I happen to still be in the camp of people who are fans of it. It’s different. It certainly stands out in a crowd of phones who keep smushing camera setups into the top left rear corner of a phone. But not only is Google’s different, it helps a device not wobble in an annoying way when sitting on a table.

With the Pixel 7a, Google is bringing the A-Series into line with the design of the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. You now have a metallic camera bar, metal housing, and a phone that looks every bit a part of the 7 Series.

The Pixel 7a is the smallest of the group and will fit nicely in the hands of those who prefer a smaller device. It’s not quite as short as the smallest Galaxy S23, the current small phone champ, but it is ever-so-slightly shorter than the regular Pixel 7. It’s miles shorter than the Pixel 7 Pro. It has buttons where Google likes them, a flat display, proper roundness to edges where needed, and an overall width that makes for an easy-to-handle phone. The size of the 7a is a big selling point, in my opinion.

I’ve been testing the 7a in the “Sea” color, which is very much a baby blue. It’s nice, if not a bit silly, but I’m all for Google and others selling phones in odd colors. It also comes in Charcoal and Snow, as well as a Google Store exclusive Coral color. The Coral color may be the best of the bunch if you can handle its brightness.

There isn’t anything new here in the design department on the Pixel 7a. It’s familiar and properly upgraded over the 6a. It looks nice, is easy to hold, and is uniquely Google. I like it.

Display. Google decided to ship the Pixel 6a last year with a 60Hz display at a time where almost everyone else in the industry was upgrading their mid-range phones to 90Hz and beyond. It was a big omission from Google and probably my biggest complaint about the phone. A 90Hz refresh rate on a display is absolutely noticeable over the standard 60Hz. The smoothness it provides should be standard in the industry at this point.

Thankfully, for the Pixel 7a Google went ahead and upgraded it to 90Hz, so that complaint of mine is gone. They also went with a flat 6.1″ OLED display with a 1080p resolution.

The display itself is not a high-end display. Its brightness always seems set to a lower level than the moment requires and content when viewed at off-angles can get dim or look funny in a hurry. I didn’t expect this display to be great, though. I just needed it to be smooth (90Hz), quick to the touch, and not awful to look at. It met all of those needs for a sub-$500 phone.

Performance. Google’s phones continue to show what is possible when the maker of the operating system fully optimizes a piece of hardware to take advantage of it. With the Google Tensor G2 inside, like we find in the Pixel 7 Pro, Google gave this phone its best processor even if that processor isn’t on the level of Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. What Google gets out of it is enough to showcase a properly running phone.

There’s a punchy snap to almost everything you do on a Pixel phone, including the Pixel 7a. The best example I can give is the combination of the haptics, software animation, and processor working together to give you the most satisfying of swipes into the app switcher UI. It doesn’t matter what you are doing on the phone, but that gesture feels so precise and perfected like no other.

From a pure performance perspective, this phone runs everything you might ask it to. Running Chrome all day, dancing in and out of Twitter and Instagram, firing open the camera on a moment’s notice, or jumping from theScore to reddit to YouTube and back again doesn’t cause the phone to hesitate. That said, I have seen the phone get quite hot when running games in any sort of warm environment. Google’s chips run hot and nothing has changed here with the 7a. Daily tasks are handled with ease – heavy stuff could heat it up.

Software. When it comes to flavors of Android that I like, Google’s is still my favorite. On the Pixel 7a, you get a Pixel experience that won’t overwhelm you, is as fine-tuned as any Android skin, and that is updated frequently and for quite a long time.

The Pixel 7a ships with Android 13 out of the box, since that’s the current stable version of Android. When Android 14 launches later this summer, this will be one of the first phones to get it. But it can also participate in the Android 13 beta or Android 14 beta programs today, if testing out new features and software is your thing. I’m all into playing with new stuff on the regular, so this is yet another reason why Pixel phones are often for me.

As far as software features goes, it’s hard not to like Google’s color UI customization that pulls from your wallpaper. It still gives you the feeling of personalized ownership that can reflect your personality and mood. Google’s Pixel Launcher remains one of the simplest and fastest to use, plus it is powered by a universal search in the app drawer that is extremely useful. The entire Google suite of apps is there and feels deeply integrated. You have plenty of display controls including a dark theme, there are haptic settings galore, and Google has one of the better sets of built-in wallpapers.

Google’s Pixel phones also just have a look that screams “Pixel!” It’s big and bubbly and colorful and fun and everything is easy to touch.

Finally, Google is once again promising 5 years of security updates. I’m not sure that they officially confirmed 3 years of Android OS updates as well, but that’s been the standard since the Pixel 6 launched. The monthly updates it receives tend to arrive at the beginning of each month and Pixel phones also receive quarterly Pixel Feature Drop updates that add new features.

Wireless charging. Yep, the A-Series now has wireless charging! While not fast, it has been a huge bonus as someone who sets their phone on a wireless charger each night to trickle charge. This is going to sound like an odd complaint, but as someone who reviews phones regularly, having to completely switch-up my systems to do so can be frustrating. A phone not having wireless charging is a pain to deal with if you are used to having it. For example, the OnePlus 11 frustrated the hell out of me because I had to physically plug the phone in each night. With the Pixel 7a, I got to seamlessly swap the phone into my life to test. I can imagine many of you will appreciate this as well.

Camera. We got a brand new camera system on the Pixel 7a that’s made up of a main 64MP lens next to a 13MP ultra-wide lens. This is the first time that Google has ditched its 12MP setup in the A-Series, so we went into this review period with open minds. As it turns out, Google is still really good at tuning cameras, even if they are new.

We’ll get to some samples in a minute, but because this is a Pixel phone, Google is including the suite of camera features you’ll find on more expensive phones. You get Google’s ridiculously good portrait mode, Night Sight for those night shots, long exposure for the creative types, real tone skin capturing, motion auto focus, and more. This is a fully-equipped Pixel phone, even if it is technically their mid-ranger.

In terms of camera performance, this camera opens as quickly as the camera on my more expensive Galaxy S23 and snaps one photo after another as quick, if not quicker. It captures excellent depth, can pull incredible photos with rich, complex backgrounds, and is good when the lighting isn’t. Google’s processing still leans cooler, which my eye still loves.

I’ve been slowly accumulating pictures from the 7a over the course of the past couple of weeks and really started looking at them during this review write-up. Honestly, I was not expecting to be this impressed. I am impressed. This is a camera I now trust and could use going forward. That’s not something I say about every camera.

Battery life. From the moment I received this Pixel 7a review unit, I’ve been wondering whether or not that average-to-poor battery life was the phone, the way I use it, or if there was some underlying reason that was never going to present itself before publishing my final thoughts. You see, I thought the Pixel 6a had poor battery life too, and the Pixel 7 certainly isn’t a battery champ, but a big part of me hoped there was something out of my control.

And then Google told us all that they had made a change on the backend of the Google app that was causing excessive heating and battery drain in the May update. That could be it! However, I’ve continued to use the 7a for two days since Google made that announcement and battery life is still not excellent. For me and my usage of the 7a, this is what it is.

My typical schedule hasn’t changed over the years. I pull my phone off the charger at 6AM or 7AM and try to make it through a day of steady Chrome, Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, Duo, Google news, and reddit usage before going to bed around 11PM. On most days, I’m between 3-5 hours of screen on time, but with this phone the system only read 3 hours one time. I don’t know if Pixel phones track screen usage differently than all other Android phones or what, but it kept telling me I was hardly using it. And that supposedly-light usage led to most days of 6-12% battery at 9PM and me swapping the phone out for another because I assumed it would die while on I finished my evening watching a show on the couch.

For comparison, my Galaxy S23 with its smaller battery (S23’s 3900mAh vs. 7a’s 4385mAh) and 120Hz display (7a is only 90Hz), typically has 50% remaining at the end of most days. My assumption is that Google’s Tensor chips just aren’t that efficient and that’s why Pixel phones tend to have poorer battery life compared to all of the other phones I test with Qualcomm chips. Either way, the Pixel 7a is not a battery champ and battery life was absolutely something I worried about every day while testing. Not fun.

Fingerprint reader. I get that this is technically a budget phone and that those types of devices often have cheaper, less-reliable components, but I’m sick of Google’s in-display fingerprint readers. They are all so bad. The Pixel 7a’s fingerprint reader feels like we’re back with the 6a’s reader, which was also bad. It’s slow, often times doesn’t read my finger well, and was unreliable enough that I did indeed setup face unlock. Thank you for that at least, Google.

Price. At $499, the Pixel 7a costs $50 more than the Pixel 6a did at launch. I thought at the time that the Pixel 6a wasn’t competitively priced and I’m close to believing that with the Pixel 7a. While not ridiculously overpriced because of the upgrades, $499 sort of takes it out of the budget-friendly realm that the A-series lives in or that we thought was supposed to live in.

But my biggest concern is about future price cuts. Google cut the price of the 6a by $120 within a couple of months of launch and then basically gave it a permanent monthly discount for an extended period of time to $299. It now starts at $349, which I absolutely would not pay because I’m sure it’ll go on sale again (it just did in March). For the Pixel 7a, you have to wonder how long it’ll sit at $499 before Google runs a similar discount scheme that drops it under $400. I would hate to see anyone pay $499 and then be mad in 6 weeks when that first Amazon-inspired summer sale goes up.

And also with that in mind, we’ll once again remind you to never pay full price for Google gadgets.

The Pixel 7a is an excellent mid-range phone with features you see in Google’s high-end Pixel 7 Pro. Its camera can keep up with the big boys, the display finally meets the moment with its 90Hz refresh rate, the software brings the Pixel vibes, and the overall size will appeal to those of us who are sick of the massive phones that have flooded the market.

There isn’t really anything to dislike about the Pixel 7a, I just wouldn’t buy one expecting it to hit most evenings with 50% battery life. For heavy users, this phone might need a charge mid-way through the day or at least before dinner to make it through the night. That’s really my only complaint, though.

At $499, the Pixel 7a probably isn’t overpriced, but you should expect to pay less assuming Google runs all of the discounts it did for the 6a. We’ve already seen a first discount and the phone has been out for a week.

The other angle here is that this phone has essentially killed any reason you’d buy the regular Pixel 7. It’s slightly smaller, making it easier to handle, has a similar display, and most of the other specs from the supposedly higher-end 7. The camera even holds its own and the software support will last longer at this point.

Text: The Google Pixel 7a (S$749) is the cheapest Pixel 7 smartphone from Google. But not by a lot. The hardware and user experience aren't very different from the other Pixel phones, either. It's essentially the Pixel 7, but with a smaller display and a different set of cameras. Sort of like how the Samsung Galaxy S23+ and Galaxy S23 are practically identical. If you want a compact Pixel that's maybe a tad easier to use with one hand, or looking to save some cash, get the Pixel 7a.

If not for the two new colours — my review set is blue (Sea), but the Coral version isn't available in Singapore — I probably cannot distinguish between the Pixel 7a and the Pixel 7. Both phones have a camera bar with the camera cutout. But the Pixel 7a has a 6.1-inch screen (like the Pixel 6a) compared with the Pixel 7's 6.3 inches. The Pixel 7a also shares many of the same features as the Pixel 7. Like wireless charging (7.5W), which is rare at this price. Wired charging, though, is disappointingly slow (18W). Other similarities include a 90Hz display, and 8GB of memory. All the Pixel 7 phones also use the same Google Tensor G2 chip. So you will get similar performance (the phone also occasionally runs warmer than expected). Even the Pixel 7a's IP67 rating is effectively the same as the IP68 rating on the higher-end Pixel 7 phones.

The Pixel 7a also has many of the same software features, like Face Unlock. Note that Face Unlock doesn't work with masks, and is less secure than the optical fingerprint sensor, so it can't be used to unlock apps or mobile payments. Other useful Pixel software are the Recorder app (great for interviews, and since last December, it's able to identify, and label separate speakers) and Clear Calling (noise cancellation for your calls). Even the camera features are mostly similar across all the Pixel 7 phones. For instance, the Pixel 7a has the helpful Photo Unblur feature that fixes blurry photo. Night Sight is just as fast. There's also Super Res Zoom, which, like the Pixel 7, is only up to 8x digital zoom due to the lack of a telephoto lens. But the Pixel 7a lacks support for HDR video or the Cinematic Blur feature for videos.

The cameras on the Pixel 7a are different from the ones on the other Pixel 7 phones. But photos retain that signature Pixel look — punchy and contrasty. Photos taken by the Pixel 7a could probably pass off as the ones by the Pixel 7. Low-light photos using Google's Night Sight also looked better (less noisy, and brighter in really dark scenes) than other mid-range phones. However, the Pixel 7a's lack of a telephoto lens means that long-distance shots resemble watercolour paintings. I typically have around 20 to 30% battery remaining at the end of the day. You'll likely need to charge the phone every night. The Pixel 7a lasted 14hr 21min in our usual video playback test at maximum brightness. That's about 30 minutes longer than the Pixel 7 Pro.

The Google Pixel 7a is so similar to the Pixel 7 that I wouldn't be surprised if Google drops the A-Series name in the future. Even the pricing is fairly close. While the Pixel 7 is officially priced at S$999, you can find it for less than S$900. Think of the Pixel 7a as the smallest Pixel instead of the budget Pixel. While you save some money by picking the Pixel 7a over the Pixel 7, S$749 for a mid-range phone is still on the high side. The Samsung Galaxy A54 5G, for example, starts from S$588. But the Pixel 7a does perform better than most of its competitors, except maybe for battery life and charging speed. So perhaps pitting it against the Galaxy S23 (around S$1,100) is more appropriate. In Singapore, the Pixel 7a comes in white, black, or blue from Google, Shopee, and Amazon SG.

Text: Google's yearly developer's conference, Google I/O 2023 is just a month away! According to the schedule, Google will kick off the event on May 10 by announcing some new gadgets as well as the next Android 14 OS. The affordable smartphone Google Pixel 7a is one of the most eagerly awaited announcements at the event. Also, thanks to the rumour mills, much of what will be packed on to Google Pixel 7a may have been outed. Here's what all you need to know.

So far, several leaked images and CAD renders have surfaced online suggesting that Google Pixel 7a will take the cues from the main Pixel 7 design. 9to5Google says that Pixel 7a may get a full metal camera frame with cutouts for a dual camera setup at the rear. However, whether will there be any change in the material used as a part of cost-cutting or not is still unknown.

The report also suggests that the Pixel 7a will feature a 6.1-inch AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate. This will be a big boost from Pixel 6a's 60Hz display. It also says that it will get an in-display fingerprint scanner.

Not sure which

mobile to buy?

Initial rumours hinted at a significant camera upgrade for the Pixel 7a, including a new sensor and a 50MP camera. However, a recent report from 9to5Google indicates uncertainty as to whether the device will feature a 50MP or 64MP camera.

Rumours suggest that the Google Pixel 7a will run on a Tensor G2 chipset exclusively designed for the Pixel 7 phone series, and may also feature wireless charging, though potentially limited to 5W. While the Pixel 6a offers 18W wired charging through USB-C, it's possible that the Pixel 7a may introduce even faster wired charging capabilities, 9to5Google added.

Google Pixel 7a price is still a secret. However, based on the previous price trends, the report suggested the price of the Pixel 7a to be around the $450-$500 mark.

Text: It’s only been about six months since the Google Pixel 6a was launched in Scandinavia, so why is the sequel coming so soon? Well, it’s because the cheaper a-model is set to arrive six months after the flagship Pixel 7, which saw the light of day in October. In other words, it was the 6a that arrived six months behind schedule in Scandinavia. Google’s strategy is that much of the technology from the top model will now move down to the a model, and then we can look forward to Pixel 8 in the autumn.

So what’s the difference between the Pixel 7a and the Pixel 7 Pro, which costs twice as much? The Pro model has a larger, higher resolution, faster screen with better image quality. It has more memory and comes with significantly more storage. The Pro model has an additional camera, a telephoto with 5x optical zoom. The battery is slightly larger and charges faster. It’s also slightly more robust.

The Pixel 7a now has the same sleek design on the camera module as the pro model, and the quality feel is far from that of a cheaper model. With its solid metal frame, it also feels stable. In our comparison of mid-range phones, the Pixel 6a was the smallest, and the Pixel 7a retains the comfortable format. However, it has become noticeably heavier. Where the 6a was among the lightest in the comparison, the 7a would have been among the heaviest.

With an OLED screen, we get the great depth and contrast that really makes colours pop. However, it is also not as bright as LCD screens. Google claims that the screen has improved brightness, but if so, this is not immediately apparent. The bigger news is that the screen has finally been upgraded to 90Hz refresh rate, so there’s a better flow when scrolling the screen.

The main camera has been upgraded to a much more high-resolution one, but Google didn’t want to reveal more than that. Image quality is very good, with correct white balance and fine colours and more detail, but a lot of that is also down to Google’s fantastic image processing. HDR images are excellent, on par with the Pro in fact, with detail in the shadows without burning out the highlights. The Pixel was already the best in its price range when it came to dark images, and now they’ve taken it a step further.

The ultra-wide angle is also new, with marginally higher resolution and a slightly wider wide angle. We’re not particularly satisfied with it, though, as it doesn’t seem as sharp as the one on the Pixel 6a, and has less detail.

Comparing 2x digital zoom, the 6a is overly sharp, the 7a softer and the 7 Pro far more detailed. With the optical zoom in the Pro model, the difference is almost laughable. Let’s just say that Google’s talk of ‘Super Res Zoom’ in the 7a is somewhat of an overstatement.

The Pixel has neither a real speaker at the top nor a headphone jack. If you want really good sound, you’ll have to use an adapter. However, we still think the speaker sound is better than on the Pixel 6a. The volume seems a bit louder, there’s no distortion, and the sound is probably a bit fuller. It’s stretching it to say that listening to music is a pleasure, but it doesn’t sound as bad as on many other mobiles.

As expected, you get a pure Android experience, but enhanced with unique Pixel features like camera quick launch, magic eraser in the photo app, and live translations. In contrast to its predecessor, wireless charging is now available.

Facial recognition is actually among the best we’ve seen on Android mobiles.

You also benefit from the instantaneous distribution of updates. Google guarantees three major Android upgrades and a full 5 years of security updates for the phone.

The big news is that the Pixel 7a has the same processor as the Pixel 7 Pro. In other words, it’s basically just as fast! However, it’s not as big a step as you might think, as the Tensor G2 processor is actually not as big a generational shift as, for example, Apple’s upgrades usually are. And when it comes to graphics, the three are actually pretty much equally fast, depending on which test you rely on. What really stands out is the battery life, which we measured at 17 hours and 14 minutes, the best we’ve seen in years!

We already praised its predecessor for its performance and camera, and now they’re even better! We complained about the slow screen and the lack of wireless charging, both of which Google has now fixed. The mobile phone also has incredible battery life. However, the price has gone up by 10 per cent.

There’s not much to worry about anymore, if you want a reasonably priced mobile phone at a reasonable price, the Pixel 7a is the one to go for right now!

Text: The Pixel 7A includes a handful of important upgrades, but on its spec sheet, there’s one that I think is the most important: a brighter, smoother-scrolling 90Hz screen. It’s not quite as nice as the Galaxy A54 5G’s 120Hz display, but it no longer means you’re putting up with a screen that’s just “meh” if you opt for the Pixel A device. We look at our phone screens roughly 20 billion times a day, so that’s a big quality-of-life improvement.

Like last year’s Pixel 6A, there’s a 6.1-inch OLED panel, an IP67 rating for robust dust and water resistance, and Google’s custom chipset du jour — this time, Tensor G2. It’s backed up by three years of OS upgrades and five years of security updates.

This time around, there’s an updated camera, wireless charging (a first for a Pixel A phone), and more RAM to help make the most of its powerful chipset. That brings the total price to $500, a significant jump from the 6A’s $450, but these upgrades are worth your time and help nudge the Pixel 7A to the front of the midrange class, not just a “buy it for the camera” alternative.

The 7A is slightly bigger than the Pixel 6A, even though they’re both built around 6.1-inch screens. It’s only a little smaller than the Pixel 7, with its 6.3-inch screen, thanks to the 7A’s thicker bezels. It has a sturdy aluminum frame, a Gorilla Glass 3 panel on the front, and composite plastic on the back. My review unit is coral, which is a Google store exclusive, and unlike the Pixel 6, there’s nothing “kinda” about it. It’s coral as heck.

The IP67 rating means that the phone is sealed against dust and is protected against some water immersion, so you don’t have to sweat it if the 7A falls into a puddle. It was the pocket of a not-at-all waterproof jacket when I got soaked in a rainstorm at the playground, and it fared just fine. It’s a step up for the midrange class, where plastic frames are more common and IP ratings are by no means guaranteed.

It’s a step up for the midrange class, where plastic frames are more common and IP ratings are by no means guaranteed.

The screen is a 6.1-inch 1080p OLED panel with a 90Hz top refresh rate — not quite as smooth as the 120Hz displays on the A54 and most flagship phones, but if you’re coming from a standard 60Hz display, it will look a little more polished. The 90Hz setting is off by default, which is probably a battery-saving move, so if you want to experience it, you’ll need to turn on “Smooth Display” in the display settings. I think it’s worth the minor hit to battery performance; it’s noticeably smoother and makes the 60Hz setting look choppy. Google says that this display gets 25 percent brighter than the 6A’s in its peak brightness mode under direct sunlight, and I can use it comfortably outdoors.

The 7A’s in-display fingerprint scanner still feels a beat slower than others in the class — that’s been a sore spot for Pixel owners over the past couple of years. In fact, I set up fingerprint unlocking on two Pixel 7As, and after running through the initial scanning, both phones gave me an error and said my fingerprint hadn’t registered. It worked fine the next time I tried on both phones, but it was very irritating to my perfectionist nature. In any case, the fingerprint scanner is joined this year by face unlock (imported from the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro). Having both enabled makes unlocking the phone painless: one or the other works quickly, and you can be on your way.

There’s a 4,385mAh battery in the 7A, a slight decrease from the 4,410mAh cell in the Pixel 6A. Google claims the 7A can go up to 72 hours on a single charge, but that’s in Extreme Battery Saver mode. Throughout my testing, I used the phone in extreme not-saving mode with the screen refresh rate at 90Hz and always-on display… always on.

With those things enabled, battery stamina feels like it’s just average. On a day of moderate use with about 3.5 hours of screen-on time, the 7A was down to 25 percent by bedtime. Adding a power-hungry activity like an extended gaming session would definitely drive the battery down faster and make a late-day recharge necessary. When you swipe down the notification shade, you’ll see an estimated time of day when the battery will be fully drained. This estimate seemed incredibly optimistic every time I looked at it, so best not to put too much stock in it.

The 7A has fast-ish 18W wired charging (no charger included in the box, naturally) and, new this year, 7.5W wireless charging. The latter is quite rare in the midrange class, and it’s nice to have the convenience of just setting it on a charger at the end of the day. It looks fancy on the pricey Pixel Stand, but the 23W fast charging speeds Google’s wireless charger offers are overkill; my basic Qi charger worked just fine with the 7A.

The Pixel 7A uses the same custom Tensor G2 chipset that’s on board the flagship Pixel 7 and 7 Pro. I feel the same way using the 7A that I did using Apple’s 2022 iPhone SE last year — this $500 phone performs better than it has any right to. It easily handles challenging tasks like rendering 3D game graphics. Apps load quickly and stay open for a reasonable amount of time; I was pleased to find the Delta app still open in the background with my boarding pass displayed after 20 minutes of doing other things on the phone.

All versions of the 7A include sub-6GHz 5G, while only the version sold by Verizon in the US will include mmWave 5G. Guess what? It costs an extra $50 for a total of $550. Most of us are unlikely to spend any meaningful amount of time within range of a mmWave signal, so paying extra for a future we probably won’t use much straight-up sucks. If you’re on Verizon and it’s feasible for you to buy the unlocked 7A directly from Google (it does trade-ins and financing, too!), I highly encourage you to go that route and save $50.

The Pixel 7A includes a new 64-megapixel main rear camera with optical image stabilization. That’s more pixels than the 50-megapixel sensors on the 7 and 7 Pro, but don’t get too excited — the sensor is physically smaller than the one on the flagships. It’s accompanied by 13-megapixel ultrawide and selfie cameras.

In previous generations, the A-series Pixel phone had the same camera hardware as the flagships. That’s not the case anymore, but it doesn’t really matter: the 7A offers the best camera system you can buy on a $500 phone. The basics are there; you’ll get reliably good photos in nice light or crappy indoor lighting. It has its weak points, and sometimes the super-smart Pixel camera gets a little too clever, but it’s an impressive overall package for the money.

In good lighting, the Pixel 7A turns in high-quality images with Google’s signature cool and contrasty look. It knows how to play the hits when there’s a blue sky and green grass in the frame, but it doesn’t go overboard. In low light, Google’s faster Night Sight mode brings out an impressive amount of detail in very dim conditions.

In moderate lighting, I got an above-average hit rate of sharp photos of moving subjects — namely, a toddler. Face Unblur occasionally jumps in and uses some extra image info from the ultrawide camera to sharpen up a slightly blurred portrait. It doesn’t work miracles, but it’s nice to have. But most of the time, the Pixel 7A is just smart about shutter speed, keeping it fast enough to freeze my subject as long as he wasn’t moving too much.

There’s no telephoto lens on the 7A — not that I’d expect one at this price — so it relies on “Super Res” digital zoom to reach up to 8x magnification. The results at 8x are predictably unpleasant, but I’m also disappointed by the quality at 2x zoom. That’s one of the focal lengths available in portrait mode, and the images it produces look crunchy and noisy. Google isn’t using the lossless crop zoom that the 7 and 7 Pro use at 2x — that’s a technique that uses the middle of a high-res sensor to produce a magnified image without the upsampling of digital zoom. After several rounds of disappointing results from the 2x setting in portrait mode, I quit using it altogether.

The main camera shoots up to 4K/60p, producing detailed clips with capable stabilization. There’s no video portrait mode, which is kind of a bummer. That’s not a feature I’ve seen in another midrange phone, and Google’s take on it in the 7 and 7 Pro still feels every bit the first attempt that it is. But the 7A surely has the processing power to keep up with a video bokeh mode, and I missed being able to use it.

A lot of the photo features Google is big on now are ones you won’t encounter until you review your images in Google Photos. That’s where I saw a few instances of the Pixel 7A camera getting a little too clever. It will automatically enable Top Shot — where it saves a quick burst of images — in some unusual instances. I saw this happen once in selfie mode where the subject (me, obviously) was barely moving and once when I was taking a photo of a mural. The resulting photos are fine, but they’re not the kind that benefit from being able to pick the best image from a batch.

There’s Magic Eraser, too, which can do a convincing job of removing people from the background of your shots, given the right scenery. It did a good enough job of taking my (patiently waiting) husband out of the background of a portrait of our son. In another instance, it offered to remove “people” from a photo; the people were actually two plastic dolls. I guess AI still can’t do it all.

While the Pixel 6A was the best midrange Android phone if you care most about the camera, the Pixel 7A is the best midrange Android phone — period. The screen isn’t quite as nice as the Galaxy A54’s, but it’s improved enough to satisfy most people. The camera doesn’t always nail it, but it’s impressively capable for this class. And even though it’s pricier than last year’s model, it comes with some serious upgrades not often seen in this class, like wireless charging.

The Pixel 7A is the best midrange Android phone — period

The Galaxy A54 has the bigger, smoother-scrolling display, and it does come with the promise of four OS upgrades in its lifetime, which is one more than the 7A. But the 7A’s flagship-grade processor puts it ahead in terms of performance now and likely well into the future. Tensor G2 is up against heavy competition in the flagship class, where it sits alongside the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, but it’s easily one of the best processors you’ll find on a midrange phone.

After a couple of years of A-series devices that felt a little phoned-in, Google has proved that it’s still paying attention to its midrange Pixel. Camera, performance, charging, display — nearly every aspect of this device has been improved a little bit. It’s not the cheapest midrange phone out there, but it’s a heck of a good deal.

Softtitle: Can Google’s $500 Pixel 7a Take Better Photos Than Its $900 Pixel 7 Pro?

Text: Read any review of Google's new $499 Pixel 7a and you'll find the same overall takeaway: It's a very good phone and an extremely great value!

The build quality is fantastic; it's got a responsive 90Hz display; Android 13 runs smoothly with the Tensor G2 chip; the battery life is the best on any Pixel phone.

But it's the 64-megapixel main camera that interests me — and I suspect, buyers — the most. See, unlike past A-series Pixel phones where the main camera had less resolution than the flagship models (i.e. Pixel 6a had a 12.2-megapixel shooter versus the 50-megapixel cameras on the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro), the Pixel 7a main camera actually has more resolution than the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro: 64 megapixels compared to 50 megapixels.

Anyone familiar with how cameras work knows the axiom that more megapixels ≠ better image quality. A larger image sensor with more surface area to capture photons is usually preferred over a smaller, higher-megapixel image sensor that collects less light; the former results in better low-light photos, and the latter, worse.

Armed with this information, I was super curious to see how the Pixel 7a's 64-megapixel camera compared to the Pixel 7 Pro's 50-megapixel shooter. Does Google's $499 phone take better photos than its $899 flagship? Is there really a $400 difference in image quality? Let's get some answers!

Before I get into the comparison photos that I know you want to skip right to, it's important to explain that although the Pixel 7a and Pixel 7 Pro have high-resolution image sensors, their cameras do not actually output photos at their respective full resolution.

Pretty much every phone with a camera image sensor that's larger than 16 megapixels does something called "pixel binning" which is the process of combining multiple pixels into a single “super” one, which then results in a photo with less resolution, but often with superior image quality than at full-res.

In the case of the Pixel 7a, the 64-megapixel main camera pixel bins images down to a 16-megapixel one. For the Pixel 7 Pro, 50-megapixel photos become 12.5-megapixel shots.

This might seem misleading. You bought a phone with a 64-megapixel camera and it doesn't even capture photos at 64 megapixels?! I agree with you, because it is misleading, and I hate it. So many people just see the megapixel count and think a higher number is better. But there are practical reasons why a company like Google uses pixel binning that go beyond marketing. The first one is storage: full-resolution photos tend to be really big files, which would quickly fill up everyone’s phones. The second reason: pixel-binned photos typically do look better with richer, sharper details, and brighter exposures in low-light scenarios.

Some phones — no Google Pixels to date — do let you unlock the full resolution of their sensors. The iPhone 14 Pro, for example, lets you shoot 48-megapixel photos in Apple's ProRAW format. Similarly, Samsung's Galaxy S23 Ultra can take photos at full, 200-megapixel resolution. If there's a feature I'd like to see Google add to its Pixel phones, it would be a setting to switch between pixel-binned and full-resolution mode. It feels strange that Google, a company constantly trumpeting choice, does not have that option in the Pixel phones.

When I asked Google whether it'd consider adding such a feature, a spokesperson told me, “We don’t share details on our future roadmap.” That's not a definitive no, but at the same time, it makes me wonder why. Can the Tensor G2 chip not handle processing images at full resolution? Maybe it can, but it’d be too long. Would the images look bad without all the processing that's done to a pixel-binned image? What could be the reason, when budget phones that use the same Sony image sensors have a full-resolution mode?

Whatever the reason is, I still wanted to see how the Pixel 7a's smaller and higher resolution 64-megapixel image sensor would fare against the Pixel 7 Pro's larger and lower resolution 50-megapixel sensor. Even if the end results are 16-megapixel and 12-megapixel photos, respectively. Shall we do some pixel-peeping?

This is your typical camera shot — outdoors where there’s good sunlight. There’s lots of street activity to let us see how well the Pixel 7a and 7 Pro’s autofocus work and compare dynamic range. As you’ll see in almost all of the below comparisons, the Pixel 7a and 7 Pro take very similar-looking photos. But zoom in — even just a little bit — and you will see some minor differences. Whether they matter to you is something only you can answer.

Also, something to note: if you’re looking at the Pixel 7a and 7 Pro photos and not seeing any color difference, that might be your display. I’m using an Apple Studio Display at 600 nits brightness and a 14-inch MacBook Pro with 1,000 nits and I can see the subtleties in color; the displays on other monitors, laptops, and phones might not show the details as clearly.

It’s really hard to spot, but the blue sky in the Pixel 7a shot is just a smidge more vibrant, the whites have worse highlights, and there’s a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it red cast on some of the whites. As my colleague Ian Carlos Campbell also observed in his Pixel 7a review, the camera seems to expose a little warmer than the usual cooler color temperature that Pixel cameras are known for.

Moving on to the next set of comparison photos taken outdoors, we have the above close-up of a garden rose. This is a good test of the depth of field on both main cameras. Despite both cameras having a main camera with the same f/1.9 aperture, the amount of bokeh (background blur) is shallower in Pixel 7 Pro shot, and that’s because of the larger sensor. Personally, I think that the bokeh on most modern phones is too shallow and prefer the mild depth of field in the Pixel 7a, but that’s my own preference.

Other than that, both photos are difficult to tell apart. Not surprising that the Pixel 7a can take a great photo when there’s ample light.

This close-up of a camera is a little more revealing. The Pixel 7a camera seems to underexpose the photo just a bit with a warmer and redder color temperature, whereas the Pixel 7 Pro exposes the white table surface more accurately. The Pixel 7 Pro has more blur around some of the edges (see: the grip and around the front of the lens); I’m not a fan of this. Even though I like more accurate white balance in the Pixel 7 Pro shot, I prefer the clarity in the Pixel 7a photo.

Again, it’s hard to tell the two below photos apart. Enlarge the photos and you can see the text is just sharper in the Pixel 7 Pro photo. The reddish tint appears again in the blinds in the Pixel 7a photo, but I bet you wouldn’t have noticed had I not told you.

Now we come to the portion where you will see the biggest difference between the Pixel 7a and 7 Pro cameras. Google’s computational photography has always excelled at taking low-light and night photos, but even so, there is no way to beat pure physics. Even with a first-class image processing pipeline, the Pixel 7a’s smaller sensor is no match for the Pixel 7 Pro when it comes to image noise and sharpness.

In the below shot, taken with automatic Night Sight, the black sky is noisier in the Pixel 7a shot and the bricks are more defined. You could throw the image into a photo editor like Lightroom and bring down the blacks, but straight out of the camera, you’ll see the Pixel 7a produces a grainier image.

In a complicated low-light scene, like this street shot at night with lots of different light sources, you can see that the Pixel 7a overexposes some of the signs. There’s a thicker halo around lights.

On Instagram, who will really complain, though? Both photos look great.

Without the magic of Night Sight, the Pixel 7a’s low-light photography falls apart. Note how the sky is more washed out and filled with more noise, and details across the entire image look mushy and dull. The Pixel 7 Pro isn’t perfect, either; the huge flare on the left side is a side effect of the larger image sensor and arguably an image defect that nobody wants.

I took another set to compare, and yeah, it was the same. In the Pixel 7a shot, the colors are duller with less contrast, shadow detail is worse, and image noise is more visible.

As you see with your own eyes, yes, there is a difference between the Pixel 7a’s 64-megapixel camera and Pixel 7 Pro’s 50-megapixel shooter. But not a big enough one that I think you should spend $400 more for a Pixel 7 Pro to take better low-light photos/night shots or to get a telephoto lens. (But who am I to judge you if you’re a night owl or like to take zoomed-in shots?)

So, what have we learned? Mainly that Google still knows how to tune image sensors to spit out really good-looking photos. Some scenarios with tougher lighting conditions will require a tweak or two in post, but for the most part, the Pixel 7a main camera takes pretty sold pictures.

It’s refreshing, actually, because the difference in image quality between a $500 phone and a $900 phone used to be very noticeable. That’s not the case at all anymore, at least not for Google’s own Pixel phones.

Text: Google is already on its 11th series of Pixel phones (when you include the budget-friendly A-series), but each one seems to have had some sort of quality control issue. The Pixel 7 aims to put it all together, and Google may have finally pulled it off.

It’s true, the Pixel series has featured plenty of weird hardware defects and software bugs. From faulty USB-C ports, lawsuits over microphones, and not being able to call 911 with Microsoft Teams installed (what?), Google has rarely released a neat and polished smartphone experience.

I’ve been using the Pixel 7 (the smaller of the two Pixel 7 flagship phones) for just under two weeks. It quickly became apparent that this experience was a little different than past Pixels I’ve used. Did Google finally release a no-compromise Pixel phone, and at a great price to boot?

The Pixel 7 features Google’s second design “reboot” of the Pixel phone series. First was the shift from the two-tone look to the offset square camera bump, and now we’re firmly in the horizontal camera bar era, started by last year’s Pixel 6 series.

I would describe the design as “friendly futuristic.” Google has managed to walk the line between looking super techy but still warm and inviting. Plus, even with a case, the phone is unmistakably a Pixel. Or, perhaps more importantly, not an iPhone. Despite being $400-500 less than other flagship phones, the Pixel 7 feels and looks like a premium, high-end smartphone.

There’s actually a practical benefit to this design as well. I don’t like how some phones with off-center camera bumps wobble when you’re typing with them lying flat on a table. That doesn’t happen with the Pixel 7. It obviously doesn’t lie flat, but it’s evenly supported across the back.

The one thing I don’t love about the Pixel 7’s design is the sharp(ish) corners of the display. Technically, the Pixel 7 is not much bigger than the Samsung Galaxy S22, but the sharper corners make it feel substantially bigger. Heavily rounded corners like those on the Galaxy S22 and iPhones have the benefit of making it slightly easier to reach more of the screen with one hand.

Speaking of the display, the Pixel 7’s is 6.3-inches with a 2,400 x 1,080 resolution and 90Hz refresh rate. I have absolutely no issue with a flagship phone “only” having a 90Hz 1080p display. That’s enough for me and I think that applies to most people. Everything is crisp and bright, the colors look great, and motion is smooth and consistent. I don’t feel like I’m missing out on anything.

I hope Google sticks with this “friendly futuristic” design language for a while. It really suits the vibe of what the Pixel experience is all about.

Google equipped the Pixel 7 with an in-display fingerprint scanner again this year. I was a bit worried about that since the in-display fingerprint scanner on the Pixel 6 series was not well received, and I think they’re generally pretty bad anyway.

The Pixel 7 has new hardware for the fingerprint sensor and the software has allegedly been better optimized to work with it. I’m on record as being very disappointed in under-display fingerprint scanners in general, but this one is not terrible. I actually don’t mind using it, which is more than I can say for the ones I’ve used in the past. The scanner is still the less-secure optical type, though.

I still wouldn’t consider it better than an “old-fashioned” physical fingerprint scanner—it’s much less forgiving if my finger isn’t placed perfectly. When it does work, it’s very fast. The Pixel 7 also has pretty good Face Unlock, but—as is typical with Android devices—it’s less secure and can’t be used to authenticate payments.

Software is a big reason why people opt for Pixel phones over the competition, so let’s talk about that. The Pixel 7 comes with Android 13 and Google’s own Pixel UI on top. It’s a much simpler approach to Android than something like Samsung’s One UI.

The crown jewel of the Pixel UI is the “Material You” theming. The lock screen, Quick Settings, system apps, and many third-party apps get their color schemes from your wallpaper. Technically, you can do this on Samsung phones running Android 13 too, but it really shines on Pixel phones.

Everyone has different tastes, but for my money, the Pixel UI with Material You is the best Android has ever looked. It feels like this is what Android has been building up to for years. A truly personal experience without requiring all the effort of deep customization.

I described the hardware design as “friendly futuristic,” and that applies to the software as well. Pixel UI has a very clean, modern look to it, but it’s also helpful and sort of playful. You feel like you’re using something that’s a couple of years newer than the current iterations of One UI or iOS.

We’ll talk about camera hardware and performance later, but the camera app has received a slight refresh. The current camera mode is displayed more clearly in the top left corner now. Night Sight shows a handy countdown timer while taking a photo. Google’s camera app has long been one of my favorites and these little improvements make it even better.

The other big benefit of Google’s flavor of Android is fast updates. The Pixel 7 will be the first to get Android 14 when that comes out in 2023, and it will get fast monthly security updates as well. Sadly, Google doesn’t support its Pixel phones as long as Samsung does. You get three years of OS updates and five years of security patches.

When people ask me which Android phone they should buy, I generally recommend Pixel phones, and the software experience is a huge reason why. It’s not cluttered with more features than you can possibly use, and the look is modern while still being accessible.

It’s time to talk about the crowing jewel of the Pixel series—cameras. Google has hung its hat on camera performance since the very first Pixel, and it continues to push the limits. The Pixel 7 has the same main 50MP camera as last year’s Pixel 6. It’s joined by a 12MP wide-angle camera on the rear and a 10.8MP selfie camera up front.

Frankly, I love taking photos with the Pixel 7. Some people may prefer to do their own manual editing, but I like that Pixel photos are more or less ready to be shared right away. Colors are vibrant without looking oversaturated. Night Sight is still the best night mode I’ve used—and the fastest. I have found myself taking a lot more photos since getting the Pixel 7.

One particular area of the camera that I’ve been impressed with is the focus. The Pixel 7 is very good at locking on the subject you select. With some phones, the focus is lost if you move around too much, but I haven’t noticed that as much with the Pixel 7. It’s especially impressive with moving subjects in videos.

As you may have noticed, the Pixel 7 does not have a telephoto zoom lens, which has become standard on many flagship phones. However, Google is doing something new this year. The “2x” button in the camera app is not just digital zoom. The 50MP camera has a sensor crop mode that uses the 12MPs at the center of the sensor to provide a full resolution, 2x zoom photo. This works surprisingly well in the absence of a true zoom lens.

The front-facing camera has been upgraded to a 10.8MP sensor and it has a wider 92.8-degree field of view. Google’s camera software magic makes selfies from the Pixel 7 look great, and the wider field of view is much appreciated for group selfies. This was an overdue update for the front camera.

Historically, Portrait Mode with Pixel cameras has been very good, but the competition seems to have caught up. The Pixel 7’s Portrait Mode is noticeably not on the same level as my Galaxy S22. I’ve thrown some pretty complex shots at the Galaxy S22’s Portrait Mode and it has performed flawlessly, whereas the Pixel 7 has struggled even in simple conditions.

Speaking of Portrait Mode, Google added a new “Cinematic” video mode this year. It’s essentially Portrait Mode for videos, and it records in a “more cinematic” 24fps. I haven’t had much luck with this mode (sample video), but I can’t say any other phone is doing it much better. It’s not a mode I see myself using very often.

Regular videos, though, look really good (sample video). The combination of optical image stabilization (OIS) and electronic image stabilization (EIS) is stellar. The aforementioned impressive focus abilities are great. The camera had no trouble keeping up with my son running around like a madman. You can even record HDR videos if you have a screen that can display them correctly.

“Photo Unblur” is a new software feature that comes with the Pixel 7’s camera. It aims to do exactly what it says—“unblur” blurry photos. You can use it on any photo, not just those taken with the Pixel 7. When it works well, it’s downright amazing, and pretty fun to use on old photos. The “Magic Eraser” feature is still here too, and it’s also amazing when it works well.

Camera quality has long been one of the main reasons why I recommend Pixel phones, and the Pixel 7 continues that tradition. It’s certainly not the clear-cut best-in-class camera experience on a smartphone anymore, but there’s nothing to dislike here. It’s good camera hardware and exceptional camera software.

The Pixel 7 is Google’s third series to feature its own Tensor processor. I had not used a Tensor-powered Pixel phone until the Pixel 7 and I’ve been very impressed.

My point of reference for performance is the Samsung Galaxy S22, which has the latest processor from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. In my real-world experience, the Pixel 7 feels faster than the Galaxy S22 in some areas.

While some chips are geared toward gaming and other resource-intensive activities, the Tensor chip is more about practicality. Some of the biggest benefits can be seen in daily life tasks, such as voice-to-text dictation and installing apps from the Play Store. The Pixel 7 blows away every other device I’ve used when it comes to accurate and fast voice typing. Plus, the Pixel 7 can now suggest emoji when voice typing.

The area where you may notice the best performance upgrade is the camera. Effects like Portrait Mode and Night Sight are applied very quickly, and photo editing is a breeze. There’s nothing more annoying than a laggy camera app when you’re trying to snap a quick photo or video. I’ve certainly had issues with that on the Galaxy S22, but not the Pixel 7.

The Pixel 7 may not wow you if you’re looking for pure, raw performance power, but that’s not really what Google is shooting for. This isn’t a processor made to get the best scores in a benchmark. Its power is focused on the things most people need for their day-to-day tasks, and that’s a microcosm of what the Pixel experience is all about.

The area of performance that I haven’t been particularly amazed by is battery life. I can usually get through a day just fine, but I’ve had to plug in the charger before bedtime on days with more heavy usage. An average day for me is off the charger for around 16 hours and about four hours of screen time.

The Pixel 7 is certainly not a battery beast, but it seems adequate for a phone of this size, especially taking my higher-than-usual usage habits into consideration. The lower power draw of a 1080p display with a 90Hz refresh rate helps with that. Google claims the Pixel 7 series can “last over 24 hours”—maybe that’s true for the Pixel 7 Pro, but I’m not seeing it for the smaller model.

It’s easy to forget that a smartphone is still a phone. Making and receiving phone calls is a core component of the experience. I had a few phone calls with the Pixel 7 and I was always able to hear the other person clearly, and I was told I sounded good too.

The Pixel 7 will eventually get a “Clear Calling” feature that uses machine learning to filter out background noise, but it’s not available at the time of this review. You can listen to the two audio clips below to get a taste of the microphone quality. The first clip is in a quiet room and the second clip has some background noise to filter out.

As per usual, Google released two versions of the Pixel 7. The two devices have more in common than not, but the Pixel 7 Pro has a few notable upgrades you should know about if you’re deciding between the two.

The most noticeable difference is the size. The Pixel 7 Pro has a larger 6.7-inch display, which has a higher QHD+ resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. That bigger footprint also allows for a bigger 5,000 mAh battery. Both devices have the Tensor G2 chip, but the Pro model has 12GB of RAM and can go up to 512GB of storage.

The two devices have the same cameras, but the Pixel 7 Pro has an extra 48MP telephoto lens. That allows it to go up to 10x full-resolution zoom with the same sensor crop technique. The 7 Pro also uses the telephoto camera for a new “Macro” mode that’s not present on the standard Pixel 7.

Essentially, the Pixel 7 Pro offers a bigger display, bigger battery, extra camera, and more RAM for $300 more than the Pixel 7.

It would be an exaggeration to call the Google Pixel 7 a “perfect” smartphone. There are some areas where it clearly doesn’t stack up to the competition. However, for only $599, it’s really hard not to recommend the Pixel 7. The number of actual complaints I have—not just knit-picks—is almost zero.

So far, the Pixel 7 doesn’t seem to have any of those weird issues mentioned at the top. It’s been rock solid in my experience. If you’ve been holding out for Google to put all the pieces together, the Pixel 7 is the Pixel you’ve been waiting for.

Ironically, the Pixel 7 is almost the mirror opposite of the Pixel Watch. The Pixel Watch underdelivers for its high price tag, while the Pixel 7 is a phenomenal device that also happens to be considerably cheaper than other flagship phones. Google is at its best when it works in this mid-premium territory. The Pixel 7 is more proof of that.

With the Pixel 7, you’re getting a device that has excellent cameras, beautiful software with fast updates, a solid in-display fingerprint scanner, great performance for your daily tasks, the best Google experience, and a premium feeling build and design for only $600. Pixel-perfect maybe not, but dang close.

Softtitle: I Love it, BUT... 🤦🏻‍♂️ — Aaron x Loud and Wireless

Text: Skip to Content

In this review, I’m going to share my thoughts about why you should get the Pixel 7a, and some things which I didn’t quite like about this phone in the time I spent with it.

First, to put it into context, this is every bit a budget device in terms of hardware if we compare them to the flagship Pixel 7 Pro and 7. But compared to its predecessor, the Pixel 6a, we are seeing some substantial upgrades, especially in the camera department.

The rear main camera now shoots 16MP, with a 13MP Ultrawide camera, instead of 12MP on both the Pixel 6a’s lens elements. It’s now capable of recording at 4K on all the cameras, both front and rear. And in terms of software, this is a lot closer to what you get with the flagship devices. Since it has the flagship Tensor G2 chip, snapping pictures with the Pixel 7a is faster. Even when using Night Sight, it feels just as quick as the Pixel 7 Pro.

It also comes equipped with flagship camera features like Magic Eraser and Picture Unblur. Those features are awesome. Magic Eraser allows you to make anybody you don’t want in the picture disappear, like photobombers or simply people you don’t like.

And with Picture Unblur you can sharpen blurry images, including the ones you took long ago.

But when shooting pictures at the fixed focal lengths, both wide and ultra wide angles, pictures shot during the day look very good. Well exposed sky, decent dynamic range, and colors look very accurate. Pictures shot at night look well exposed as well, across the frame, but not to the point of overexposing artificial lighting.

When shooting landscapes, it does tend to have a bit too much yellow in the greens sometimes, but apart from that I’m very happy with its color contrast. Instead of having up to 30 times Super Res Zoom like the 7 Pro, the 7A only has up to 8 times, due to the difference in camera hardware (it doesn’t have a telephoto lens). And somehow, its Super Res Zoom isn’t as impressive. It doesn’t seem to be as sharp at 8 times Super Res Zoom, even compared to the 30 times on the Pixel 7 Pro.

It could be due to the fact that the flagship Pixels can use the full 50MP sensors by default without pixel-binning whereas the 7a pixel-bins its 64MP sensor to 16MP by default, which impacts resolution.However when shooting videos, it does now shoot up to 4K on all the cameras, both front and rear, with the rear cameras being able to shoot up to 4K 60fps. And when shooting videos, the footage looks well stabilized, even in low light situations, plus it’s got impressive mic pickup too with great noise reduction. And it was able to isolate my own voice very well against the background. Watch the samples here.

In terms of audio from the speakers, there is a speaker on each end of the device. It’s loud enough that you can hear your content in a noisy outdoors situation, and its quality is quite acceptable if you’re not fussy about sound. But if you’re a bit more fussy about sound, like me, the speakers sound thin and boxy in the vocal range. Plus there’s little to no stage separation so if you’re playing games or watching videos, it’s not going to sound cinematic at all. Listen to the samples here.

It doesn’t support Dolby Atmos either so if you want anything close to immersive sound, you’ll definitely want to use earbuds. And if you use earbuds, it also lets you customize the EQ of the audio using the Sound Amplifier app. So it’s your choice whether you want to make it sound more bassy or bright, more laid back or aggressive.

And it helps that the 7a does support codecs like LC3, and even the more popular Hi-res codecs like aptX HD and LDAC. Because if you’re an audiophile, you might want to use this as a wireless streaming source.So what do I like about the Pixel 7a then?For its price, it is looking like great value if you want a very good camera in a budget phone. To me it’s not just about color accuracy, smooth, natural looking images. Those things are important, but it’s also what happens after you shoot the image. With features like Photo Unblur and Magic Eraser, it’s a very different experience from other phones. These are tools which are baked into this device itself, that lets you enhance pictures without needing to use other apps.

Another reason why you should get the 7a is the software updates. This is stock Android, and when Google rolls out new software updates and features, Pixel phones will be among the first to get them. Very important because this also includes security updates.Its thermals are manageable. When using the camera feature for extended periods, it does tend to get hot eventually, but when doing other things like gaming and watching videos for long periods of time, it gets warm but not enough to make me want to put down the phone for a bit.

Its battery life is pretty decent. I did get a full day’s usage from this device, even with the outdoors shooting. And at the end of the day I had around 30% battery left.So, in short, excellent camera, stock android, decent thermals, and good battery. Those are reasons to get the Pixel 7a.But what are some things I don’t like about the Pixel 7a?Yes, I do feel that its screen is pretty smooth and snappy. But it feels very dated because it only has FHD+ resolution with 60hz screen refresh. Although it’s possible to push this to 90hz for certain apps, that will definitely eat into its battery life. And under direct sunlight, it’s not very bright, you do need to push the screen to maximum brightness for it to be usable under direct sunlight.

One thing I will mention is that when shooting pictures and video, the colors can look a bit more saturated on the phone’s screen compared to the actual results of the picture.Its underscreen fingerprint sensor… works, but not all of the time. Very often it fails to register the tip of my thumb. And I often have to fall back to entering the password, or using face unlock, which is a lot faster.

And finally, what I also don’t quite like is its screen to body ratio. That bezel around the screen makes this device look very dated compared to other budget devices.

So a lot of what I don’t like about this device has to do with its screen, and if that’s all I’m looking at, I wouldn’t buy the Pixel 7a. But If I don’t want to spend too much money, but I still do want to shoot great pictures and video with great mic pickup, stock Android experience, first to receive all the updates, I’ll definitely go for the Google Pixel 7a.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a Review: A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing?

Text: In 2022, Google surprised many when it decided to bring its Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones to India.  Between the two, the Pixel 7 was launched at Rs. 59,999, but can now be found at around Rs. 55,999 online, making it more accessible than any of its predecessors. Google recently launched the Pixel 7a in India, its 'pocket-friendly' version of the Pixel 7. This new phone has received several upgrades over its predecessor, the Pixel 6a, and surprisingly comes in at the same price of Rs. 43,999 for the sole variant with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.

Without a massive price difference between it and the Pixel 7, should you pay an additional Rs. 12,000 for the more premium model, and is the Pixel 7a worth upgrading to from a Pixel 6a? Let's find out.

The Google Pixel 7a may appear premium at first glance, but it's just as much of a smudge and dust magnet as the Pixel 6a was. These smudges are quite hard to notice on the Snow finish, but the Sea and Charcoal finishes probably won't be so forgiving. Since the rear panel is made of plastic just like the Pixel 6a, it tends to get scratched easily. While its design mimics the premium look of the Pixel 7, it's definitely not the same when it comes to quality of materials used.

I found the edges of the rear panels to be slightly misaligned on my unit as they didn't have a seamless fit where they met the metal frame. The same also applies to the metal rear camera band, which could have benefitted from better finishing as it is noticeably sharper in comparison to the better made camera module on the Pixel 7. The previous Pixel 6a did not have any such imperfections, so it's disappointing to see this on the new model. However, you can simply slap on a case and forget all about it.

The Google Pixel 7a's rear panel is made out of plastic

The Google Pixel 7a also feels a bit heavy at 193g but is still quite compact and good for one-handed use. The Pixel 6a is a lot lighter at 178g but the additional weight of the new model is probably down to the addition of wireless charging. This could also be the reason why Google went with a smaller battery for the 7a, but more on that in a bit.

What I like about the Pixel 7a's design is that just like its predecessor, it is still one of the very few smartphones in this segment to offer an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, with Samsung's now dated Galaxy S20 FE 5G being the other.

The Pixel 7a offers the latest and greatest from Google when it comes to processing power. The Tensor G2 SoC which is also present in the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro models (as well as the recently announced Pixel Fold) now comes to Google's affordable A series. Apart from being more powerful and power-efficient compared to the older Tensor processor, it also adds some additional camera and photo editing features.

Google still does not offer any RAM or storage variants and the 128GB of UFS 3.1 storage might not be enough for everyone, as the Pixel 7a does not support expandable storage. There is no free cloud storage option (anymore) either, apart from a few offers which expire in a couple of months. However, it's nice to finally see 8GB of RAM being made available on a Pixel A series device for the first time ever.

The Pixel 7a (right) appears a lot more premium compared to the Pixel 6a (left)

The fingerprint reader is embedded in the 6.1-inch full-HD+ OLED display, which has a 90Hz maximum screen refresh rate. Thankfully, it's not as troublesome as the Pixel 6a's fingerprint reader when it was launched and worked reliably out of the box. Communications standards include Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC and support for a multitude of 5G bands. There's a single nano-SIM slot but users can add a second phone number to their device by using the eSIM feature.

The Google Pixel 7a is powered by a 4,385mAh battery, which is smaller than last year's model. Charging speeds have been capped at 18W for wired charging and 7.5W for wireless charging. As always, Google does not provide a charger in the box.

The software experience on the Google Pixel 7a is typically Google with Android 13 and the slightly customised Pixel software experience. There are no additional apps or bloatware as one would expect from a Pixel device. There's nothing new here compared to what I experienced on the Pixel 6a or even the Pixel 7 models which we reviewed last year. Google promises three years of software updates and five years of security updates. There's also the usual feature drops, which should instil confidence in buyers who are new to the Pixel brand.

The overall design of the Google Pixel 7a appears very much like the premium Pixel 7

In terms of performance, Android 13 ran smoothly without any hiccups. The 8GB of RAM in the Google Pixel 7a also helped when it came to multitasking, keeping apps in memory for a while. The 90Hz refresh rate also helped with the software experience by a large margin, making the entire interface appear quite fluid compared to the 60Hz panel on the Pixel 6a.

Colours, when viewed in the 'Natural display' colour mode, are quite accurate and the display was bright enough when used outdoors during the day. It is also HDR10-certified and most apps like Netflix, Youtube and Prime Video supported the same, with content appearing as expected.

As for raw performance, the Google Pixel 7a scores better than the Pixel 6a in most benchmarks and produces numbers that are on par with the premium Pixel 7. The 7a managed 7,16,837 points in AnTuTu, and 1,396 and 3,116 points in Geekbench's single and multi-core tests respectively. In terms of graphics, the Pixel 7a managed 90fps, 85fps and 60fps in GFXBench's T-Rex, Manhattan 3.1 and Car Chase test suites, respectively.

Gaming performance was quite good overall. I tried out Call of Duty: Mobile and could comfortably play it at its default settings (Very High graphics and framerate) without any lag or stuttering, which was not possible on the Pixel 6a. Touch sampling rate was adequate for playing such mobile titles and I was able to make full use of the 90Hz refresh rate by switching to Ultra framerate in the game's settings.

The phone does get warm when playing Call of Duty at Ultra settings. However, I did not notice any performance drops even when gaming for up to 30 minutes at a stretch.

Despite the processor upgrade, the Google Pixel 7a has to keep up with the demands of a 90Hz display and do so with a smaller battery than last year's model. Our standard video loop battery test on the 7a fared worse than the Pixel 6a, managing just 12 hours, 39 minutes on a single charge, which is average for a small phone, but below average for its segment.

With my typical daily use, which included scrolling through social media apps, video streaming, some camera usage and about an hour of gaming, the Pixel 7a barely made it through a full day with about 10 percent charge left in the tank. All-in-all, this definitely isn't a phone for power users.

The Google Pixel 7a is the first A-series Pixel to come with wireless charging

Since there's no charger in the box, I plugged the Google Pixel 7a into a 61W USB PD charger. Despite the claimed 18W charging speed by Google, the phone took a good two hours and seven minutes to fully charge, which is very slow. The 7a does come with wireless charging, which is another first for a Pixel A-series device. This is good for keeping it topped up at all times when not in use, provided you have several wireless charging pads in your home or office. Indeed, I would have preferred a bigger battery or faster charging, instead of wireless charging and smaller battery.

The cameras on the Google Pixel 7a are another area to have received noticeable upgrades. The primary camera has been upgraded to a 64-megapixel sensor with OIS. The ultra-wide camera has also been bumped up from a 12-megapixel sensor to a 13-megapixel sensor. And the same goes for the selfie camera, which has been bumped up from an 8-megapixel camera to a 13-megapixel camera. Despite the varying sensor resolutions, all three cameras capture 12-megapixel binned images by default, but the setup still lacks macro photography capability.

The Tensor G2 SoC also brings some handy camera tricks as we have seen with the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro models. There's no Action Pan mode like on the premium Pixel 7, but you do get a Long Exposure mode which manages some quality long exposure photos without the use of a tripod. The new Night mode is almost twice as fast as the Pixel 6a's Night Sight mode and this also applies to the post capture processing. Also available, is the Photo Unblur feature which basically removes the minor blurring from images that have it. I found this especially useful when trying to run and capture photos of my kid.

The Pixel 7a's Tensor G2 SoC enables features such as Long Exposure mode

What I did notice while capturing photos and videos outdoors is how quickly the Pixel 7a heats up. This increases quickly when using the more processor intensive camera modes like Portrait mode or Long Exposure. On several such occasions, when switching to video mode to record 4K videos, I did get a pop-up notification stating that the device is too hot and that video quality may be reduced, but the camera app did not close. I also had background photo back-ups disabled when reviewing it, so clearly that did not contribute to the heating.

Thankfully, the Google Pixel 7a's imaging chops are quite capable. To give you an idea about the 7a's camera improvements, I have included some comparison samples with last year's Pixel 6a.

Google Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a daylight camera samples (tap to see full size)

Daylight imaging quality is quite impressive. The new cameras and processor bring improvements in dynamic range and overall details. These are initially hard to spot unless you “pixel” peep, but a majority of photos taken with the Pixel 7a mange to capture those extra textures that are either missing or appear soft in photos taken with a Pixel 6a. The Pixel 7a also ends up delivering more accurate colour tones overall. There's no macro mode like on the Pixel 7 Pro, but I managed to get some close-ups which appeared almost identical on both devices.

The new ultra-wide camera offers a noticeably wider field of view compared to the older one. There's noticeable barrel distortion along with purple fringing, but these are still one of the best ultra-wide photos you can get on a smartphone at this price point.

Google Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a portrait selfie camera samples (tap to see full size)

Selfies from the Google Pixel 7a in daylight came out a bit soft and showed less detail compared to the selfies from the Pixel 6a. The new 13-megapixel selfie camera also has a much tighter frame when shooting selfies, which makes it hard to include more than two subjects in the frame, unless you have very long hands. In low light, the Pixel 6a managed better selfies than the 7a, which was a little surprising.

Google Pixel 7a vs Pixel 6a low-light camera samples (tap to see full size)

Shooting with the rear cameras in low light was a much better experience on the Pixel 7a. The Tensor G2 processor makes it far more capable for capturing sharper images of moving kids or pets (subjects that never stay still). When using the dedicated Night Sight mode, the Pixel 7a manages sharper and more blur-free photos of moving subjects or objects in any given scene. The level of detail is similar with both the 6a and 7a, but colours are better on the latter. In more dimly-lit scenes, the Pixel 7a comes out of top offering slightly better detail and sharpness. The ultra-wide camera captures decent quality images in low light when used with the Night Sight shooting mode, but showcased a lot of crushed blacks in the shadows.

The Pixel 7a's digital zoom manages superior images in all types of lighting conditions thanks to the larger sensor and Super Res Zoom technology

While Google's Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro models fared a lot better, the Pixel 7a does not pack certain camera hardware such as the multi-directional PDAF, laser autofocus, and more. It also lacks HDR10 recording capability, which is possible on the Pixel 7. Regardless, 4K 30fps video recording on the Pixel 7a had good details in daylight but showcased purple fringing in the bright spots. 4K 60fps video looked a lot better in comparison with a steady framerate. In low light, the Pixel 7a managed better quality video with a lot less noise than the Pixel 6a, when recording at 4K 30fps and 60fps.

From the various upgrades the Google Pixel 7a has received, the selfie camera and reduced battery life seem to be the only main compromises. The Pixel 7a is finally on par with the competition thanks to the Tensor G2 SoC and comes with a clean Android 13 interface which cannot be matched at this price point. In more ways than one, it's definitely a worthy upgrade even for those using a Pixel 6a (Review).

If you are looking for faster charging, then the OnePlus 11R 5G (Review) is a much better choice with better battery back up and 100W wired charging at your disposal, but it lacks wireless charging and an IP rating. This makes the Pixel 7a a very unique offering as it offers good value and a very unique set of features at Rs. 43,999, which includes very capable cameras.

Its only real competitor is the Pixel 7 (Review) which is currently priced at Rs. 55,999, which offers a bit more polish when it comes to design and build quality, more capable camera hardware, and reliable battery life. For power users, these things would matter and spending that premium over the 7a might be worth it for some.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a Review

Text: Google Pixel 7a Review – Google Pixel 7a was announced today at Google I/O 2023 but I’ve actually got a hold of early review device from Google Australia beforehand. The Pixel 7a is Google’s mid-range answer to the latest Pixel phone series. You may have read our review on the Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro, and possibly have heard about the Pixel 7a rumours before. We knew that it’s coming, especially since Google also released the Pixel 6a in the previous series.

If you are not thinking of purchasing the greatest Pixel phone ever, the Pixel 7 Pro (or even the Pixel 7), you might actually be enticed to grab the Pixel 7a instead. It sits slightly below the Pixel 7 (in terms of specs and features). Pricewise, Pixel 7 Pro retails for A$1,299, Pixel 7 retails for A$999, and the Pixel 7a retails for A$749. So what do you get at $250 less?

It’s probably worth talking about the difference between the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7a first. After all, you might want to know what specs are different and whether you should grab the 7a or just spend more money and get the Pixel 7 instead.

* Pixel 7a has smaller screen dimensions (a few millimetres difference), a 6.1-inch vs 6.3-inch. It has a slightly larger PPI as a result.

* Pixel 7a’s screen is covered by Gorilla Glass 3, vs Pixel 7’s Gorilla Glass Victus (which is supposed to be more resistant than Gorilla Glass 6)

* Pixel 7a has a slightly larger battery capacity but in real life, it doesn’t affect the battery life much.

* You can’t use Pixel 7a to charge other devices wirelessly on its back (i.e no Battery Share feature)

* Pixel 7a has different rear and front camera system (obviously, to save costs).

* Pixel 7a only has two microphones, compared to Pixel 7’s 3 microphones set up.

* Pixel 7a has slower wired charging (18W compared to 21W on the Pixel 7 and 23W on the Pixel 7 Pro). It also has a slower wireless charging rate.

Google Pixel 7a is made based on the following success of the Pixel 6a, according to Google. It has the same familiar shape with the camera bar design we’ve grown accustomed for and for the first time in the A series, the phone has metal buttons for the more premium feel. There’s a significant change internally with an all new mid-frame architecture to better protect the display during an accidental drop.

It has a 6.1-inch FHD+ (1080 x 2400) OLED screen at 429 PPI with 90Hz refresh rate for a smooth display. Sure, it’s not 120Hz like the Pixel 7 Pro but 90Hz is a really good number to pick during the designing of this phone.

The 90Hz option is off by default though and I was wondering why the scrolling wasn’t as smooth as expected when I set up the phone for the first time. To enable 90Hz refresh rate, search for it under the Display settings.

It’s powered by 8GB of RAM with Facial (2D mapping) and Fingerprint unlocking on the display itself.

Google Pixel 7a is powered by the same chip powering the other beefier Pixel 7 devices: Google Tensor G2 and also the Titan M2 security chip. These mean you get all the Pixel’s features such as the amazing computational photography that I love with the Pixel phones, along with useful and magical features like Photo Unblur and Magic Eraser.

The Photo Unblur works on photos that were taken by other phones as well. To see how good the Pixel’s Photo Unblur function is, make sure to check my coverage in the Pixel 7 Pro review article.

For the rear camera system, you’ll get a 64MP main camera with f/1.89 aperture and 13MP ultrawide camera with f/2.2 aperture. Combined with Google’s amazing computational photography, you’ll most likely get great results from whatever photos you’re taking and at whichever conditions.

Google Pixel 7a has made it into the mid year, offering a mid-range device from the Pixel 7 family and it would be as popular as the Pixel 6a for sure. Those who don’t really need the fanciest camera or just want to take photos occasionally should be happy with the Pixel 7a, thanks to Google’s powerful software that do postprocessing to the photos really well.

The Pixel 7a is quite enticing as it’s powered by the same, powerful Tensor G2 chip, Titan M2, with similar specs. This means you get all the amazing tools and features that the chip can offer. Do make sure to re-read the comparisons section again on the top if you are still deciding whether you want to get the Pixel 7 or Pixel 7a.

With the Pixel 7a, you’ll get five years of security updates and three years of Android/OS updates. As a bonus, you’ll also be getting the VPN by Google One even if you don’t have a Google One premium membership. Google Pixel 7a is available at A$749 on Google Store and select retail partners starting from today, and comes win Charcoal, Snow, and Sea colour options.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a Reviews Appeared

Text: Google Pixel 7a was presented only today, but reviews of thematic resources were published immediately after the announcement, so it is already clear what the novelty is.

Resource The Verge rated the new Google smartphone at seven points out of ten. In the pros, he recorded a good build, long-term software support, the best camera in the class, a 90-Hz screen, water protection and wireless charging, and in the minuses, the price increased by $ 50 relative to the Pixel 6a, problems with the fingerprint scanner and not very high quality digital zoom camera. However, Google can fix the last two points with updates.

The reviewer notes that the Pixel 7a is almost identical in size to the Pixel 7 with a smaller screen. All because of a very wide frame. Charging the new Google is not particularly fast: 18-watt wired and wireless – with a capacity of only 7.5 watts.

The autonomy of the smartphone is average. With active use, the author got 3.5 hours of screen with the remaining 25% charge.

By the way, it would be useful for potential buyers to know that the 90-Hz screen mode is disabled by default, which, apparently, was done for the sake of autonomy. But users who do not understand these issues may never turn on the increased frequency in the end.

Probably the main problem with the Pixel 7a is the Pixel 7. The latest Google is selling for $600 right now, which is not much more expensive than the younger model. That being said, the Pixel 7 benefits from better case materials, a narrower screen bezel and a larger display, and possibly a camera as well. But here it is still worth waiting for comparative tests.

Text: The latest Pixel refresh is a mid-year update to the entry-level model in the range, and this time the new Google Pixel 7a includes a number of updates that will benefit photographers, including an updated main camera, and the addition of the motion modes found on the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro.

The Pixel 7a comes in at $499 / £449, which is a slight bump in price compared to the Pixal 6a which had an RRP of $50 / £50 less, although you’ll often find it on offer for even less than this.

Does the new Pixel 7a offer enough to make it the best budget camera phone for photographers? Find out in our review.

We review smartphones from the perspective of choosing a smartphone for it’s photography and camera performance, so we’ll be starting by looking at what the Google Pixel 7a offers in terms of cameras and what features are included for photography and video.

The design of the Google Pixel 7a should look familiar to anyone who’s seen other Pixel phones, with the now standard visor bar across the back housing the dual camera unit. The Pixel 7a steps up the quality in both styling and feel compared to the 6a.

However, there have been a number of improvements made to the smartphone this time round, and whilst they may seem relatively minor, they make a noticeable difference and make this smartphone stand out more, particularly in this sub 500 price point.

The rear cameras have both been updated compared to the Pixel 6a, and similarly the selfie camera has been upgraded to a 13MP camera, now with 4K video, rather than FullHD video on the 6a.

The two rear cameras are now made up of a 64MP f/1.9 main camera with OIS, with a wider view at 25mm equivalent, and 16MP pixel-binned images. The ultra-wide-angle camera is a 13MP f/2.2 camera with a 14mm equivalent. Both support 4K video, with the main camera offering up to 60fps.

The 64MP main camera gives 16MP pixel-binned images, giving a higher resolution than offered by the Pixel 7 Pro, although of course, there is no telephoto camera, so the Pixel 7a has to rely on digital zoom, or Super Res Zoom, like the Pixel 7. By default this gives a 2x option, but you can pinch the screen to zoom even further, up to 8x.

Long exposure has been added, for the first time in the a series, as found on the 7 and 7 Pro, and this is useful for waterfalls, light trails, or crowds etc. However, unlike other smartphones, where you can hold the button for as long as you want, on the Pixel 7a (and other Pixels) the length of time is controlled entirely by the phone, so at times the exposure can be shorter than you wanted.

Real Tone is included, and this is an AI system that has been trained with over 10,000 portraits of people of colour, so that the camera can give improved auto white balance, to ensure people of colour, especially those with darker skin tones, are rendered authentically.

Night Sight is said to be improved, with improved low-light performance, it’s also been designed to be quicker than previously. You can adjust the length of time, if you want a longer exposure, and higher quality.

Magic eraser is available, and can be found when viewing photos back in the photo gallery. You’ll need to go into the editing options to find this feature.

Photo Unblur is designed to unblur any blurry photo – and works with new photos as well as any old photos in your photo library. It’s also designed to work with faces.

The battery is designed to give at least 24 hours of operation, and this can be extended further with extreme battery saver. The battery is a 4385mAh unit, which is fairly generous, however the relatively slow charging at 18W is poor compared to many other smartphones. Wireless charging is supported which is nice to have.

The Pixel 7a camera app is a rather simplistic affair, with options to switch between the cameras, as well as switch to a 2x zoom mode. Like other Pixel smartphones, there is no pro or expert mode available, meaning you won’t find full manual controls on this phone.

However, that’s not to say that you can’t achieve quite a few different things with the right situation. For example, in the Night Sight mode you can adjust this from 3s to 6s, and when the phone detects a stable base, it can extend this even further, with up to a 4 minute exposure possible, making it suitable for astrophotography.

In terms of manual controls, the phone does let you adjust the white balance as well as the exposure, and in advanced options you can enable RAW+JPEG shooting. Beyond this you’re fairly limited.

The main 64MP wide-angle camera gives impressive results – and is surprisingly capable of close-up photography, such as food photography, with little effort.

Colour reproduction is very pleasing, with great results straight away. Images also appear to be consistent, from shot to shot, as well as between the different cameras on the phone.

Dynamic range, and HDR is handled automatically, and the camera can cope very well with scenes with high levels of contrast.

There are times when images can look very saturated, but generally they give a realistic representation of the conditions. You also get 16MP images, thanks to the pixel-binned images from the 64MP sensor, giving it an edge, in terms of resolution over other smartphones which tend to give 12-12.5MP images.

The 13MP ultra-wide-angle camera gives very good results, with relatively low levels of noise, and very good colour reproduction. Distortion is fairly well controlled, although does become apparent in some circumstances, depending on what you’re photographing.

Digital zoom is available as a 2x option, using Super Resolution Zoom, and can give good results, and they look good on screen, but can be lacking in detail, especially compared to actual 2x optical zoom cameras.

You can zoom further by pinching, but again, there is no real match for a telephoto camera, and if you need to go much beyond 2x zoom, then the Google Pixel 7 Pro or another smartphone is needed.

Whilst the camera doesn’t specifically talk about “Macro shooting”, the close-up focus of the main camera is good enough for close-up shots of food, pets and other small objects, and if you use the 2x option, you can take frame-filling close-up photos of objects as small at Hot Wheels cars.

The selfie camera is a 13MP unit, with fixed focus, and portrait mode is available. This automatically blurs the background, and does a relatively good job of cutting out the subject, without making too much mess of the hair.

This performs best in good light, with lower detail shown in low-light shots. As it’s fixed focus you’ll need to make sure you’re the optimum distance from the camera for the sharpest results, too close and your face will be blurred.

Video recording gives you options for 4K at 60fps from the main camera, or 4K 30fps when using the selfie camera. There are slow motion and time lapse options, as well as a range of video stabilisation options, including standard, locked, active and cinematic pan. For those interested in recording voices, there is a “Speech enhancement” option designed to improve audio when recording in busy environments.

The Google Pixel 7a is available for $499/£449, which makes it competitively priced with other sub-$500 smartphones, such as the Nothing Phone 1 (around $400), and even begins to give the Google Pixel 7 a run for it’s money, with a higher resolution main camera, and a higher resolution selfie camera.

With the Google Pixel 7a offering such a competent and well-rounded camera system, it really does make you wonder if you need to spend more than $500/£450 for a smartphone. When you can get the Google Pixel 7a, and it performs this well, do you really need to spend double this price, to get a flagship camera phone?

Google once again proves that you don’t need to spend big money to get an excellent smartphone, and whilst it’s a shame this phone isn’t the same RRP as the Pixel 6a was, the slight increase in price seems well worth it.

The Pixel 7a gives you two rear cameras that perform very well, with a main camera that gives a higher resolution final image than many other phones, a great ultra-wide-angle camera, along with a much-improved selfie camera. The fact that the selfie camera offers 4K video recording, is impressive, especially since some smartphones that cost double the price don’t.

There’s even a good level of close-up performance from the phone, and even though it doesn’t offer a dedicated macro mode, we were impressed by the results it offered, as close-up photos showed plenty of detail. Whilst you don’t get a pro or expert mode, you do get a whole host of useful photography features, including motion blur (for creative waterfall shots and more), night mode, magic eraser, plus portrait modes that make you look great.

Sure, the phone is missing a dedicated telephoto camera, but if you just want the occasional 2x photo, then the Pixel 7a can produce decent results. At this price point, there’s no other phone I’d recommend, and therefore the Google Pixel 7a comes highly recommended.

Text: Each benchmark score shown on this page is the median of all the results submitted by users for this device. For popular models, the median scores are calculated from thousands of benchmark results.

Some people test their device under less than ideal conditions. For example, the device may be too hot or have other apps running in the background. These results tend to lower the average score, but we include them in the calculation because it provides a better indication of real-world performance. You may get a higher score when testing your own device under optimal conditions.

The battery life shown for a device is the median of all benchmark results for that model. Battery life is very sensitive to changes in screen brightness. While we recommending calibrating the screen brightness to 200 cd/m2 (nits) when testing battery life, this setting cannot be enforced by the benchmark app. As a result, the range of battery life scores submitted by the public is much wider than that seen when testing under controlled conditions.

The popularity rating is based on the total number of benchmark results submitted across all tests in the last 30 days. This page is updated daily.

Text: It’s been noticed that Google has raised the bar of the smartphones with latest specs and 5g connectivity and also posing a great competition to Apple along with other big mobile players. It can also be seen with its latest Google Pixel 7a proves that it is loaded with almost all sorts of connectivity as well as other specs which are hard to find in other mobiles which are available in a similar price range. If you are looking to buy a stylish and slim smartphone by Google then you are at the right place as here we will discuss the pros and cons along with detailed specs and features to give a good idea about this 5G mobile.

It’s unmatched feature list include a large 6.1-inch OLED touchscreen with a resolution of 100 x 2400 pixels along with 90Hz refresh rate, a powerful 8GB RAM, a 4385mAh battery with fast charging along with wireless charging, a 128GB internal memory which cannot be expanded, a Gorilla Glass 3 screen protection, an IP67 rating, a 64MP + 13MP dual primary camera with dual LED flash, a 13MP front camera, an Android 13 OS with super-efficient Octa-Core 2×2.85 GHz Cortex-X1 & 2×2.35 GHz Cortex-A78 & 4×1.80 GHz Cortex-A55 processor, a Mali-G710 MP7 GPU, a USB Type- C port.

Another positive is the lightweight nature of this 5G mobile as it measures152 x 72.9 x 9 mm and 6.84 oz only.

Based on its detailed specs and features along with online reviews we have concluded its pros and cons of this amazing 5G mobile.

* Super virtual size 6.1-inch OLED touchscreen with high refresh rate and resolution gives immersive viewing experience to the user

* Powerful 8GB RAM- Excellent for smooth multi-tasking and playing heavy games with ease

* Exquisite a 64MP + 13MP dual primary camera with dual LED flash and AI technology clicks superb 4K videos and HD shots

* Decent 13MP front camera captures crisp and clear HD selfie shots and videos

Slim and stylish Aluminum design gives it a premium look

* IP67 rating makes it water and dust resistant to make usable in all-weather type

* An Android 13 OS with super-efficient Octa-core 2×2.85 GHz Cortex-X1 & 2×2.35 GHz Cortex-A78 & 4×1.80 GHz Cortex-A55 processor makes it easier to do lag free multi-tasking and easy game playing

* Long-lasting 4835mAh fast charging and wireless charging works well even on heavy usage

* Optical in-display fingerprint sensor provides secured and safe access to the user

128GB internal memory gives lots of space to store data

* FM Radio is not available

* Wireless charging is not available

* Non-expandable memory as there is no option of SD card slot

It is launched in Coral, Sea, Snow and Charcoal colors for $469.

It is an expensive 5G mobile with dual SIM capacity for that too with Aluminum body and Plastic front having almost all the latest features and specs which are easily found in other smartphones of not just in similar price range but also at the lower price. The point is that except the Google brand all the specs are commonly available at a cheaper price range of any other brands In fact better specs in terms of camera and battery backup. Anyways, it is definitely not a cheaper 5G smartphone and the large immersive screen size provides a nice viewing and gaming experience to the user. The 8GB RAM is quite powerful for hiccup and lag free multi-tasking which is further supported by the Google chipset, latest Android 13 OS with super-efficient Octa-Core 2×2.85 GHz Cortex-X1 & 2×2.35 GHz Cortex-A78 & 4×1.80 GHz Cortex-A55 processor. Moreover, the battery backup is good and well supported by fast charging along with wireless charging which is still unspecified. It does not support reverse charging which might irk some of the users as it is again a normal feature which is being readily available in other mobiles of similar price bracket.

It has Gorilla Glass 3 screen protection and IP67 rating which makes it a tough mobile which can be carried outside without much worry. The 128GB internal memory is enough to store large data but it does not support external memory card which means that the users need to be careful while selecting the variant. Although it support USB Type- C port for fast data transfer which will take only few minutes to transfer data at the fast rate. Otherwise, cloud space can be used to upload data and manage the mobile space. Anyways, it is not a major disadvantage and can be managed easily. The primary camera is exceptionally good but the front camera lens is just 13MP which decent and does not fall under the great category.

Final words: Overall, it is a decent offering but the price is quite high but to some point it is justified by the specs and features offered in it. The design is premium and the dual SIM functionality is there which allows to use one 4G SIM and one 5G SIM without a micro SD card. If price is not the hindrance then it could prove to be a good option to upgrade as the closest competitor is OnePlus 11. Hence, those who are interested in it can also go for OnePlus 11 because the camera setup is much better as compared to it. Even the AMOLED display gives a real immersive feel during online as well as offline binging. It is also noticed that it does not have any special cooling features to maintain the temperature so, it cannot be termed as a gaming mobile despite having 8GB RAM, Android 13 OS and Octa-Core processor with huge internal space.

Softtitle: The Google Pixel 7 is the best Android phone for most of us
Publisher: Digital Spy
Author: 
Date: 2023-05-05T14:32:00.000Z
Text: We updated this review in May 2023 and spotted the excellent  is currently discounted by almost 20% at Amazon. We have updated our links in this review if you want to grab our pick for the all-around best Pixel phone – and the best Android phone for most people – at a lower price.

Google isn't reinventing the wheel with the . It's a polished and refined upgrade to 2021's Pixel 6. The good news is that we already highly recommend that variant and its cheaper sibling, the Pixel 6a, and that remains the case when it comes to the newest model, and its new affordable companion, the Pixel 7a.

Here you're getting the best possible Android experience, Google's Tensor-driven smarts, a terrific camera setup, and a few little refinements that improve the minor drawbacks of the predecessor (yes, the fingerprint sensor is far better).

But (and it's a crucial but), this one costs £599 at full price while the  (and comes with a free pair of earbuds at the moment). Are the iterative upgrades really worth a full £150 more? That's the big question.

Whichever model you pick, we reckon the Pixel lineup is the way to go for anybody after an Android upgrade without the annoying bloatware that you can find on certain other devices, and the stability and smoothness of Android 13 are enough to make even the most obsessed iPhone diehard think twice about switching.

While the stats show that Google's handsets still make up only a small portion of all the smartphones out there in the wild, that number is growing faster than other brands and we can report that we've spotted an increasing amount of Pixel devices in the hands of our fellow commuters (it helps that the camera bar makes them distinctive!).

After testing it out for six months, we still think the new Pixel 7 is the best Android smartphone for most people, especially if you don't need the bigger display, slightly better battery and more advanced cameras of the .

However, there's not a huge difference between this and the old Pixel 6, which is way more affordable to buy refurbished, or the newer Pixel 7a, which is the starting point we'd recommend for bargain hunters in 2023. It's also possible to find the Pixel 7 with significant price cuts, so it's worth hunting around for low prices.

• Screen size: 6.3 inches

• Resolution: 2400 x 1080 pixels

• Processor: Google Tensor G2

• Cameras: Two rear cameras (50MP main and 12MP ultra-wide angle) and 10.8MP front camera

• RAM: 8GB

• Storage space: 128GB or 256GB

• MicroSD card slot: No

• Weight: 197g

From the outside, it might look like there's little difference between the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 7.

Both phones have a clear visual identity with an edge-to-edge "camera bar" on the rear. On the new model, this has changed texture, now in matte aluminium. It looks sleek and classy, although we're aware this design has its detractors and, yes, it won't sit flat on the desk without a case.

To be honest, though, a case is essential here, given the slipperiness of the glass on the back of the phone. We're rocking the excellent , made in collaboration with Google. It's grippy and stylish (we especially love the walnut, black leather and aramid fibre looks), with the added benefit that it works with a bunch of Magsafe accessories designed for iPhones, like some of our favourite power banks and wireless chargers.

There are some changes that are almost imperceptible unless you're holding the 6 and 7 side-by-side. The new one is a tiny bit smaller with a 6.3-inch (rather than a 6.4-inch) display, and it's a little lighter than its predecessor too.

We like the colour range, especially the fun "Lemongrass" shade of our review unit. "Kinda Coral" and "Sorta Seafoam" lovers will be disappointed, though, as the 7 doesn't come in those colours – its other two hues are white or black (or "Obsidian" and "Snow" if you prefer Google lingo).

If you're looking into buying a Pixel smartphone, it's safe to say you probably care a lot about how good it is for photography. We're always snapping away on our phones too, and the good news is that this is yet another brilliant Google camera driven by software.

The iPhone may still be king when it comes to video but it's not as clear cut when it comes to still photos. The Pixel often delivers results that need less editing and attention before posting on your Instagram feed.

On the actual hardware itself, the Pixel sports the same combination of a 50MP main camera and a 12MP ultra-wide. That main camera will be the go-to option and it delivers excellent results, while there's a telephoto setting that uses the central portion of the big sensor.

On test, the shots from all the rear cameras were excellent, always detailed, colourful, accurate and contrasty. The main actual hardware upgrade is the higher-resolution front-facing camera, which selfie fans will appreciate.

Google also improved on its "Face Unblur" feature that it added to the camera last year with an overall "Photo Unblur" to rescue your ruined shots no matter what camera they were shot on. You can dig out old snaps shot on your point-and-shoot from 2007 and it should be able to fix the blurriness.

We tested this out and we're impressed at how good these results are. This editing wizardry is driven by the new chip in the Pixel 7, so it's one of those features that you can't enjoy without buying the new phone.

If you've got a massive collection of photos you want to repair, the way the unblur addition could bring memories back to life may make it worth the price of the upgrade.

Below we've included a selection of photos we've shot with the Pixel 7, including some that use the portrait mode and the ultra-wide lens – these are all completely unedited, showing off the colours and clarity that you'll get without any extra fine-tuning:

Much like the "Cinematic Mode" on iPhone 13 and 14 models, the new Pixels come with a mode that adds blurry "bokeh" to the background of your videos. This is one addition, though, that doesn't feel quite there yet.

We compared the results we got to videos we shot on the iPhone 13 mini, and those from the dinky iPhone look much more natural. The Pixel struggles with subject detection and tracking in this video mode, and the blurry edge around the subject looks a little artificial.

Hopefully, this improves with some software updates in the future.

Battery life on the Google Pixel 7 is improved due to the addition of Google's upgraded Tensor G2 chip. On paper, stats boffins may look at the processor and see a relatively minor upgrade, but it has benefits for machine learning and efficiency.

Google boasts about faster performance for low-light photos, the "unblur" feature to fix dodgy snaps and better on-device speech recognition (we tried its transcribing feature and that's also superb).

Because it's more efficient, there is a battery life improvement too. We should say that we never had any issues with the Pixel 6, and the solid battery life on the Pixel 7 is impressive. It's a technically smaller battery, yet still rated to last over 24 hours. Like on the old model, this gets us through a day of normal use with zero issues – and we haven't noticed any major issues after six months.

There are two handy quality-of-life improvements worth mentioning too. The first is that Google fixed the temperamental in-display fingerprint reader that's a bit slow on the Pixel 6 and is now perfect on the Pixel 7. We've got no complaints.

And, in addition to that, you've now got a face unlock function too. This isn't as secure or as advanced as a full-on 3D system like Apple's Face ID (which is reflected in how it can open the phone but not confirm payments or authenticate entry into banking apps), but it's still more than good enough for most people and there won't be delays when unlocking your phone.

We like the Pixel 7's display for all the same reasons we like the one on the Pixel 6 – there isn't all that much of a difference between them. It's still a stunning, bright and vibrant panel.

Most people will love the smoothness and fluidity of its 90Hz refresh rate, and the implementation of the always-on display is far better here than it is on the more expensive new Apple iPhone 14 Pro.

Whether you're gaming, scrolling through your TikTok FYP or catching up with the latest episodes of Queen Charlotte, you'll have no problems with this screen.

As mentioned above, the cinematic video is pretty ropey and you'll probably want to avoid it. And, like on the previous version, there's no slot for a memory card so you'll want to decide whether you need the 128GB or 256GB variant you need before you hit "add to basket".

These aren't major issues but, for us, the biggest downside is just how much here is comparable to the existing Pixel 6. That one is far better value when you compare both side-by-side. We love the Pixel 7 but if you're on a budget at all, the 6 is the way to go.

The Pixel 7a also complicates things by including many of the features from the Pixel 7 at a lower cost. It'll give you a slightly lower battery life than the 7 but we think it is the best budget option for many people, especially if you'd prefer a smaller screen.

It should come as no surprise that the Pixel 7 gets a thumbs up from us – it's an excellent smartphone and, even if we pretend that the Pixel 7a doesn't exist, it's still terrific value at its starting price of £599 (it's currently down to £469).

We live in a world where you can buy the Pixel 7a, so we'd still go with that if you want most of what's great about a Pixel at a lower price (we're in a cost-of-living crisis, after all).

If you must have the latest and best from Google, you can't go wrong with the polished Google Pixel 7. Compared to the Pixel 6, the design is more refined, it's got the latest clever features, new photography skills and an improved high-res selfie camera. And while it shares a lot with the 7a, it's the better pick for battery life, faster charging and a bigger display.

Text: You know the drill by now—the Pixel a-series is the best phone line Google makes. A combination of good design, a great camera, the right specs, and a low price makes it our usual recommendation for prospective Android phone buyers on a budget. The Pixel 7a presents more of that winning formula, and a few key upgrades this year make it so good that the more expensive Pixel phone directly above it—the $600 Pixel 7—is now basically obsolete.

Since the phone has been fully unveiled today, let's go over the specs. First up, the price—it's $500, which is $50 more expensive than last year. That extra fifty bucks gets you some big upgrades over last year, though, like a 6.1-inch, 90 Hz, 2400×1080 OLED (the 6a has a 60 Hz display); 8GB of RAM (formerly 6GB); 7.5 W wireless charging (formerly no wireless charging); and a 64 MP main camera that's new to the Pixel line.

Other expected specs are here, too, like a Google Tensor G2 SoC—that's the same chip the more expensive models have—plus 128GB of storage, IP67 dust and water resistance, 18 W wired charging, and Wi-Fi 6e. There's a marginally smaller battery, which is officially 4385 mAh (it was formerly 4500 mAh).

Just like the Pixel 7, the Pixel 6a is getting a slightly wider rollout this year, with 17 regions listed on Google's spec sheet: the US, Canada, UK, Ireland, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Norway, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Japan, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, and India. Congratulations to the new Nordic countries on that list, which are getting Google's mid-range phone for the first time. Google only has about 113 more countries to go to match the hardware operations of Samsung and Apple.

Normally, we would be ready to enshrine the Pixel 7a as the mid-range Android phone to buy, but Google is throwing us a bit of a curveball this year: The Pixel 7a is no longer at the bottom of the company's phone lineup. The old phone, the Pixel 6a, will continue to be sold, and it's getting a $100 price drop. The Pixel 6a will now cost $350. This is a Pixel 7a review, but it's hard not to be distracted by the Pixel 6a's super-hot new price tag. At just $350, the Pixel 6a is very attractive. Is a Pixel 7a worth $150 more?

While we're getting distracted, let's take a look at Google's entire phone lineup:

Raise your hand if you can come up with a justification for the $600 Pixel 7 versus the $500 Pixel 7a. Is 0.2 screen inches worth $100? In a press briefing during the lead-up to the 7a's release, Google was asked about cannibalizing Pixel 7 sales with the release of the Pixel 7a. Although Pixel 7a product manager Justin Savage pointed to the Pixel 7's glass back and "better" camera, he admitted that Google "really wanted to build the most competitive device that we possibly could."

So there you have it: The competition is everybody else, and Google isn't that concerned about killing the Pixel 7. That's probably the right move—the company doesn't have enough market share to worry about undercutting its own products.

Google must also not be concerned about undercutting the Pixel 7a with the Pixel 6a's price drop, as that $350 price tag makes the Pixel 6a the best deal on this table. Do you need a 90 Hz screen in a budget phone? Google's SoC hasn't really changed year over year. The Pixel 6a camera is still fine. Wireless charging isn't that big of a deal, especially since it requires spending more money on accessories.

The only downside is Google's surprisingly short and uncompetitive support window: the Pixel 6a is scheduled to stop getting major Android updates after July 2025. Normally, Google offers three years of major OS updates (for comparison, Samsung offers four), and the Pixel 6a is already a year old. That could be a good reason to opt for the Pixel 7a—it's 42 percent more expensive for 50 percent more update time. Still, Google offers five years of security updates, so you may be tempted to hang on to your Pixel 6a for a few more years.

The Google Pixel 7a is a fun little device with helpful features. It might not be the phone of the year, but it is certainly the best small handset on the market right now. For camera software, processing power, and price it cannot be beaten.

The Google Pixel 7a could well be the best camera phone you can buy for under $500/£500. It’s both a wonderful little smartphone and also a timely reminder that a good phone needn't cost you the best part of a grand.

It’s modeled on last year’s Pixel 7 and 7 Pro, but this is actually the successor to the Pixel 6a. The ‘a’ series is generally a more affordable version that’s released almost a year later with reduced specs and capabilities. However, this year it appears that Google has found a way to embed some of its best features in its more affordable handset.

There are still some limitations, however, such as the smaller screen (6.1in) and the 90Hz refresh rate rather than the 120Hz that was found on the Pixel 7 Pro. There is also only an 8GB model with 128GB of storage available, but that is arguable where you're saving money as the Pixel 7a is just $499/£449.

See the best Google Pixel 7a cases

For a budget phone, the Pixel 7a has a surprising amount of quality; from facial recognition to a 64MP main camera lens, it has more than you expect for a sub-$500 phone. However, the two key features this year are both the size of the handset and its Tensor G2 processor.

This is the smallest Pixel 7 device currently on offer at just 152.4mm tall and despite the shorter display, it is an OLED panel that still packs quality with a highly responsive 90Hz refresh rate and punchy color coverage.

However, the inclusion of Google’s Tensor G2 chip offers users the same innovative experience as the premium Pixel models. Real-time language translations, audio transcriptions, rapid image editing, and an ever-helpful Google Assistant. This is, by far, one of the most useful devices around.

Being the ‘a’ model of the Pixel 7 means that there is no change to the design; in fact, it’s hard to see the difference between the 7a and the regular 7 with the former just 0.2 inches shorter and just a tad squarer. There are some material changes, however,  with recycled plastic used for the back cover. The chassis and camera bar remain aluminum while the screen is fitted with corning gorilla glass.

Smaller handsets are better for those that like to operate single-handedly and also feel a bit more comfortable when taking pictures on the move. The obvious downside here is that the user interface is smaller and things like the digital keyboard become a tiny bit harder to use. It isn’t a major issue, though I did find it slowed my text typing speed when on the move.

In a relatively short period of time, the Google Pixel has become synonymous with great photography. This is largely down to the Tensor chip enabling a range of rapid image enhancement capabilities and some innovative editing software. The 7a has a 64MP main lens that takes nice crisp shots and a 13MP ultrawide lens that allows you to take in more of the picture. There is also a high res function that works like a telephoto lens, though at 8x optical zoom, it isn’t quite as impressive as Huawei's P50 Pro or the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.

The Magic Eraser feature is again the star of the ‘tools’ section, allowing you to remove unwanted objects in the background. However, there is also a ‘Camouflage’ feature that can be used to change the color of an object so it blends into the background. The aim here is not to remove them, but to make them less obvious in the photo. Much like the original eraser it isn’t perfect and sometimes it just turns people's clothes brown or green.

Night mode on the Pixel 7a is good, but it works best in certain scenarios. Scenes with neon light produce the best results, whereas normal low-light settings tend to offer up grainy images. What is pleasing is the speed with which the images are captured; the processing takes just a second. On the 7 Pro, an image took a lot longer to capture, but the 7a gives the same clarity and color in low light settings seemingly in a third of the time.

For video, you can shoot in 4K with either 30 or 60fps, and all with good image stabilization. The slow-mo function is arguably the best feature here, though it works best at x1.8 rather than the default x1.4.

Below are some sample images taken with the Google Pixel 7a.

With its Tensor G2 processor, the Pixel 7a really is a smart phone. This is a Google-developed chip that can process many of the phone’s AI-based functions on the device in real-time, such as live translations or complex image editing.

On the Geekbench 6 website, the Pixel 7a has a score of 1405 for single-core and 3,436 for multi-threaded workloads. That’s near enough the same as the Pixel 7, though it isn’t anywhere near the iPhone 14 and Apple’s A15 Bionic processor. But that doesn’t really explain what either phone can do in terms of processing speeds.

For real-world use, the 7a is an amazing handset that does genuinely make life that little bit easier. No other phone can match the Google Assistant which makes browsing and controlling the device so simple. From transcribing audio into text messaging to translating menus into different languages, it is more useful than any phone I have ever had the pleasure of testing.

The battery is also very good; it almost made it through 24hrs with my excessive social media scrolling, which is about the same as the larger Pixel 7 Pro. No model of iPhone will do that and in my opinion, the only device that will surpass those times is the more expensive Samsung Galaxy S23.

Charging is less impressive, with 18Wh ‘fast’ charging and 7.5Wh wireless charging – neither was particularly rapid. It managed to go from less than 10% to over 70% in around 50 minutes, which is a bit poor for busy people.

I also found the initial setup of the device very frustrating as it failed, multiple times, to transfer my data from my old phone. In the end, I simply did the painful task of setting the device up without a data transfer (you can, of course, get all that from a Google backup). This could well be a teething issue as the handset is so very new and it is something Google can probably fix with an update.

The fingerprint reader is also a little inconsistent. Pixel devices are becoming notorious for software glitches and the fingerprint reader is a regular offender. It’s not a massive issue, but it is annoying enough to simply stop using it altogether – thankfully, the facial recognition system is more consistent.

At 6.1in the Google Pixel 7a is as small as a modern smartphone can be without overly reducing quality. It isn’t quite as little as the iPhone SE but it is still smaller than what most consumers will be used to. This might not be for those with massive hands or people that want a big bright screen for streaming.

What it is, however, is a fun little device with helpful features. It might not be the best phone of the year, but it certainly offers the most value for money right now; for camera software, processing power, and price it cannot be beaten. It is, pound-for-pound, the best smartphone around.

The smaller models of iPhone 14 and Samsung Galaxy S23 might be the direct competitors to the Pixel 7a, though both are at least $200 more expensive.

In terms of budget smartphones, the Honor 70 is a slightly cheaper offering, though it doesn’t quite have as many high-grade features.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a review: Meet the new best sub-$500 Android phone

Text: Smartphone shoppers are eating well this week. Google just announced its first-ever foldable, the Pixel Fold, for $1,799, and discounted its most affordable phone, the Pixel 6a, . And if you can't decide between splurging for a fold or hitting the budget road, there exists the .

Let me be clear: The Pixel 7a won't win any design awards. And its not-so-smooth alignment of back glass and aluminum frame should tell you all you need to know about where the phone sits within Google's Pixel hierarchy.

Also: All the hardware Google announced at I/O 2023

But at the end of the day, it's an A-series device; the fifth generation of its kind. That means Google has had years to refine, polish, and upgrade its mid-ranger formula, and the maturity shows on the new Pixel.

This is a mid-range phone done right. Mostly. Here's why.

There are three major improvements to this year's Pixel A-series device: Display refresh rate, an upgraded processor, and wireless charging, all of which were expected arrivals sooner or later. As a result, the Pixel 7a also gets a price bump from last year's $449 to .

A fast refresh rate display really spoils you. It certainly has for me. So you could imagine the grin on my face when Google decided to bring the smoother panel from its flagship Pixel line down to the 7a.

The outcome is a clean Android experience that's just as smooth to look at as it is to swipe, tap, and interact with. And scrolling through longer webpages doesn't come off as a blur of text, but rather a river of perceptible words that make the visual of it easier on the eyes.

Note that by default, the Pixel 7a is set to 60Hz; you'll have to dig into the display settings and toggle on Smooth Display in order to see (and feel) the difference. Even then, Smooth Display is only an adaptive refresh rate setting, meaning the Pixel will throttle between 90Hz and 60Hz depending on what task you're doing and the phone's battery life.

From what I could tell (or what I couldn't tell?), the shift is not that aggressive, which is great.

The Google Pixel A-series is finally getting wireless charging -- but there's an asterisk there. The charging rate maxes out at 7.5 watts, which is not the best, but also not the worst. It takes a good two hours to charge the phone from 0% to 100%, so I'll let you decide what to make of that.

Also: Google announces the Pixel Tablet, and it's not the iPad killer we hoped for

That shouldn't be a problem if you've assimilated into a wireless-powered lifestyle and often plop your phone onto a charging dock at any given moment. I'm guilty of that, so I appreciate the existence of the Pixel feature more than how capable it is.

Google's flagship processor, Tensor G2, has also made its way into the Pixel A-series, bringing improvements to the 7a's machine-learning capabilities, computational features, and overall efficiency.

All that is to say that the Pixel 7a breezes through most apps and services that you throw at it, from daily activities like social media browsing and emailing to more strenuous tasks like exporting 360-degree videos and running GPS navigation in the background. The phone gets warm to the touch, but never to the extent of discomfort.

The camera system on the Pixel 7a is as performative as Google's best phones, and I'm getting natural-looking images with fantastic dynamic range most of the time, but the post-processing perks are what separate the phone from other sub-$500 offerings like the  and .

Photo-editing tools like Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur are enabled with Tensor G2 at the helm, and there are other Pixel favorites, like Long Exposure, that I used to capture the moving subway below. You'll get some ghosting effects if you're not holding the phone steadily when it's capturing such images, but when everything goes as planned, you end up with photos that would typically require a tripod and other accessories to capture.

The Pixel 7a is not perfect, and has its reasons for being relatively affordable, though I'll admit that finding its flaws was not the easiest. In fact, there are only two aspects that I would suggest improving heading into the next model.

When you introduce a more powerful SoC and a faster refresh rate display, but keep the battery capacity roughly the same as last year (4,385mAh from 4,400mAh), endurance numbers are bound to take a hit.

On average, I got about two and a half hours of screen-on time with the Pixel 7a; not great, but acceptable if you can deal with battery anxiety or don't label yourself as a power user.

Dialing the refresh rate back down to 60Hz got me about 30 minutes of more usage, but at that point, you're better off picking up the  -- which Google still sells in stores -- that gives you 80% of the Pixel 7a experience.

Review: Google Pixel 6a: Half the price of a Pixel Pro, but just as good

The middling battery life is only further emphasized when you realize the phone only charges at 18W, wired. That's compared to similarly-priced competitors that are slowly but surely adopting faster 30W and 65W charging rates.

There are two solutions to the above problems, as I've hinted in the titling: A larger battery, faster charging, or both! A larger battery size, even if it's at the expense of a slightly thicker phone, would put the Pixel 7a comfortably at the top of my recommendations lists.

It's only May, but New York is in full-on summer mode right now. That means there's a street performance every other block, tourist mayhem, and the sun beaming down with pride. And as I make my commute to the office, I can't help but notice how difficult it is to see what's on the Pixel 7a screen when outside.

Also: Patch your Pixel and Samsung phones immediately. Here's why

Perhaps I should've expected this when I found myself setting the brightness to around 80% at home. Even as I'm typing this review from the ZDNET office, the Pixel's adaptive brightness thinks that 100% is the most appropriate level in this ambiance.

A Google spokesperson tells me the Pixel 7a gets up to 500 nits on regular brightness, with a peak of 1,000 nits for HDR and high brightness mode. From what I'm seeing, that may not be enough to beat the sunnier months to come.

The  delivers the best A-series experience yet, with much-desired improvements like the 90Hz refresh rate display, wireless charging, and the company's latest Tensor G2 processor. That all contributes to its $499 price tag, snapping the A-series streak of $449 over the past two generations.

For the new price, the Pixel 7a is in a very interesting position within the Google lineup. It's about $100 less than the still-relevant , which has a better camera system, larger display, and longer battery life, and is about $150 more than the still-available , which provides a similar Android experience but without the fancier display and charging tech. If you can't decide between either end of that spectrum, then the 7a may just be the right phone for you.

If you can live without the 90Hz display and wireless charging, then I'd look at the Pixel 6a, which Google still sells for $349.

For a mid-range Android that puts display quality and battery life front and center, check out Samsung's A54 5G.

For $100 more, the Pixel 7 gives you a better camera system, a larger display, and a more premium build quality.

Text: When I reviewed the Google Pixel 6a a year ago, I had very few critiques about the device which offered a very similar experience to that of the 6/6 Pro at a much cheaper price point, with a few key shortcomings.

Google has now revealed the Pixel 7a, and it’s safe to say that the device is a big step-up, not only being in line with the Pixel 7 in certain areas, but actually going one better at a cheaper price point, to really blur the lines between flagship and mid-tier (if you can call it that) in the best way possible.

Firstly, let’s start with the display. The Pixel 7a once again has a 6.1″ AMOLED display but the big improvement this year is that it has a 90Hz refresh rate which is in line with the Google Pixel 7. This is a big improvement over the 60Hz display that in the 6a and really makes scrolling content a lot more enjoyable.

From a design point of view, the Pixel 7a follows in the foot steps of the 7 and 7 Pro with a much more premium design. It comes in Charcoal, Snow and Sea and rather than adopting a two tone design like last year, Google has now gone with a much more uniform design. Whilst there’s still no glass on the back (you’d be hard pressed to tell), there’s also metal buttons for the first time in an A-series device. The camera hump is also a lot less pronounced giving a nicer finish all-round.

There are a couple of really big inclusions on the Pixel 7a. In addition to under display finger print unlocking, there’s now face unlock which is basic in function, but works really well alongside the fingerprint unlocking to make sure that your phone is getting unlocked by one of the biometric unlocks.

Another big inclusion is wireless charging which has been added to the Google Pixel 7a. The wireless charging charges at a speed of 5 watts with wired charging now charging at 20 watts.

The Google Pixel 7a has a 64 megapixel wide camera, which is beyond what’s available in both the 7 and 7 Pro. It also provides super res zoom up to 8x with a 2x optical zoom. There’s also a 13 megapixel ultra wide zoom.

The photos produced by the 7a are excellent. They are crisp, full of colour and it’s honestly hard to take a bad photo using the 7a cameras. Paired with Google’s incredible photo syncing, it’s really a genuine joy to use and capture memories both around the house, and whilst traveling around.

Night Sight has been updated and is reported as being 2x as fast and sharp than what was in the previous model, and there’s also fantastic features such as Photo Unblur and Magic Eraser which I’ve gone on time and time again, and really just enhance the photo system within the camera.

The front camera has also been upgraded to 13 megapixels and similarly, provides a really crystal clear result and is great both when photographing indoors and outdoors in almost any lighting condition.

The Google Pixel 7a is powered by the same Google Tensor G2 processor as the 7 and 7 Pro, which means that zipping around apps is a super smooth experience, but it also means that the battery life is fairly impressive. I was easily able to see out the day using the 7a. Google rates the battery at 24 hours or up to 72 hours with Extreme Battery Saver turned on.

On the security front, it’s being powered by Titan M2, and all of the features such as VPN by Google, as well as clear security settings that let you control how you want your phone to operate are all there as well.

Google’s entire software experience still really feels like the best of both worlds in terms of ease of use and customisation, with widgets being super easy to setup, and also aesthetically pleasing, but also providing enough depth with the information that you’ll be after, whether it be the weather, your appointments or what is trending on TikTok.

All-in-all, it’s really hard to fault the Google Pixel 7a both from a hardware and software point of view, particularly at the $749 price point that it’s hitting. It’s miles ahead of the Pixel 6a and you’ll be hard pressed to find a better phone at that same price.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a is a great potential swan song for the Pixel A-series

Text: Google made its budget phone so good that it might have to stop making budget phones altogether.

Rumors are swirling(opens in a new tab) that Google might kill the Pixel A-series line in 2024, and for good reason: The cheaper handsets are starting to resemble the previous year’s flagships a little too much. That’s definitely the case with the $500 Pixel 7a, Google’s newest phone and possibly the final A-series Pixel.

Announced during the 2023 Google I/O presentation, this is essentially a $100 cheaper Pixel 7 with a slightly smaller screen, but little else in the way of compromise. Its performance and battery life remain exceptional, while its main camera got a megapixel upgrade while retaining all of the same software wizardry that made last year’s Pixel 7 phones so great.

In other words, the Pixel 7a might be the phone the Pixel 7 should’ve been all along. Android lovers in need of an upgrade may want to jump on this deal before Google kills the best value in smartphones.

As is tradition with Pixel A-series phones, the Pixel 7a did not get a significant facelift from its more expensive older sibling. The signature metallic camera bar on the back returns, along with the single-tone color scheme that unfortunately made the Pixel 7 a lot less distinctive than the Pixel 6. That said, the color choices this time are nice: white, black, orange, and light blue.

Really, the only mildly shocking thing about the Pixel 7a is how much its specs resemble the Pixel 7, less than a year after that phone came out. Everything listed below is the same as the Pixel 7, unless noted otherwise:

* 6.1-inch display with 90Hz refresh rate (was 6.3-inch on Pixel 7)

There are a couple of notable and very welcome inclusions here that help justify the Pixel 7a costing $50 more than last year’s Pixel 6a. First up is face unlock, which makes unlocking the phone so much faster that you may find yourself never using the under-display fingerprint sensor again. The Pixel 7a also boasts wireless charging, giving it another big leg up over its previous A-series brethren.

Google Pixel 7a

Starting at $499 at the Google Store

I also shouldn’t just breeze past the 90Hz refresh rate, a first for Pixel A-series. It’s not a step up from the Pixel 7, but with that and everything else being nearly equal, it’s a big reason to discourage anyone from buying a Pixel 7 at this point. It’s also unquestionably an advantage over the Pixel 6a, which was locked to 60Hz.

That smooth refresh rate bolsters a performance profile that’s every bit as sublime as it was last year.

Put simply, this phone does not hitch or slow down or anything like that throughout the course of a normal day. Perhaps there’s something you can do with it that would cause slowdown in extreme scenarios, but the Tensor G2 chip powering the Pixel 7a holds up under everything resembling normal circumstances that I saw.

Google also brought over the AI-powered software enhancements from the Pixel 7. Things like graphical user interfaces for automated phone calls, speaker tags for transcribed voice recordings, and clearer-sounding phone calls all return from last year, as well. None of that is new, but it’s nice to have compared to the Pixel 6a.

Of course, none of that matters if the phone doesn’t have a sturdy battery. Good news: It does!

I got a little more than 24 hours of normal use (social media, streaming music and videos, web browsing) out of a full charge. That’s a very minor step up from the roughly 22 hours I got out of the Pixel 7, but at that point, you’re splitting hairs. You’ll only have to plug this phone in once per day at most.

You only get two lenses here.

I’m going to preface the point I’m about to make by saying the Pixel 7a’s camera array is quite nice. As you’ll see soon, photos taken on this phone look fantastic and the suite of software features to enhance photos is as good as ever.

That said, I still think people who fancy themselves mobile photographers should go with the Pixel 7 Pro over the Pixel 7a. The main reason I say that is because the Pixel 7 Pro’s zoom lens is one of the most impressive things I’ve ever seen on a smartphone, while the 8x zoom on Pixel 7a can look a little janky under certain conditions.

An example of the 8x zoom looking pretty good.

And an example of it not looking so good.

Zooming in on something without a lot of detail produces a clean enough image. However, you can see where the software steps in to correct things if you zoom in on something like a tree. The image begins to look cartoony and fake in a really off-putting way.

Aside from that, though, it’s hard to complain about the results I got from my camera testing. Images taken on the main lens on default settings look sharp, colorful, and vibrant.

Portrait mode continues to produce some of the best depth-of-field effects in the smartphone game.

And Night Sight is still arguably the best nighttime photography mode in the business. Google is really good at brightening images without losing the nighttime atmosphere. It only takes a couple of seconds to generate each image, too.

Lastly, Google ported over some of the Pixel 7’s AI features to the camera, as well. The big one is Photo Unblur, which can take mildly blurry photos (even those taken on other phones) and make them sharper. It’s tough to test because the camera frankly doesn’t take blurry photos unless you try really hard, but the results are pretty much as advertised.

The aforementioned (rumored) death of the Pixel A-series may turn out to be false. Sometimes people get it wrong. That’s fine.

But if it is indeed true, Google’s latest and potentially last Pixel A-series phone is a very good one. The Pixel 7a gives you everything the Pixel 7 offered, just with a slightly smaller screen and $100 shaved off the price.

All of those fancy Tensor G2 AI features are here. Another excellent camera array (though not as excellent as the Pixel 7 Pro’s) is here. All-day battery life is here. And most importantly, it just works as you’d expect, with no performance problems to speak of in my time with the Pixel 7a.

At just $500, the Pixel 7a is the Android phone to get if you don’t feel like spending flagship money.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a puts on an impressive performance in JerryRigEverything durability test

Text: Google recently introduced the Pixel 7a — a confusingly priced budget phone that’s costlier than its predecessor, but cheaper than the Pixel 7, while trading a few features to achieve said price. With Google’s tendency to prefer an all-plastic build on the a-series, one would presume there’s no way the Pixel 7a is sturdier than the flagship Pixel 7 Pro. However, YouTuber Zack Nelson’s classic durability test has a surprising conclusion.

ANDROIDPOLICE VIDEO OF THE DAYSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT

The JerryRigEverything channel has earned a name for itself in the tech YouTube community for videos that push devices to the physical limit of their endurance. With the $500 Pixel 7a, Google seems to have made a pretty sturdy phone, despite the liberal use of plastic in the construction. The phone has metal side rails, detachable metal buttons, and a metal SIM tray, all with adequate sealing to maintain the IP67 water resistance of the device.

The Pixel 7a’s display survives for 25 seconds directly under a lighter’s flame, and the OLED panel recovers completely as well. Its camera visor is still made of metal, and scratches easily. The screen has Corning Gorilla Glass protection, so it should be okay sharing a pocket with your keys and coins, but sand and other harder substances can leave a mark. The plastic back panel also gives in to scratches from a razor blade. So, you’ll be better off buying a protective case for your Pixel 7a, but not for the same reasons as the 7 Pro.

Nelson suggests we avoid associating plastic with low-cost or cheap items, noting that toys and tools built to last also use plastic. While we understand Google’s use of plastic on the Pixel 7a helps bring the cost down, there’s the counter-argument that the display is glass whether you like it or not. Nonetheless, the newest Pixel isn’t as weak as the 7 Pro, as we can see in the final bend test.

Google has also made an interesting design decision of having the metal camera visor separate from the metallic frame of the new budget phone. Although it looks like a structural weak point, the phone holds up to Nelson’s powerful bend tests admirably well, showing zero signs of permanent deformation. So perhaps a slim case would suffice, because Google’s design doesn’t need help with the structural rigidity here.

Google clearly learned valuable lessons from the Pixel 7 Pro’s design, and has made the Pixel 7a almost twice as rigid for just over half the Pro model’s price. You’re getting your money’s worth here, and the Pixel 7a is well on its way to becoming one of the best budget phones out there.

The Pixel 7a doesn't quite fit into any one box. On one hand, it's Google's cheapest phone — but on the other, it matches the flagship Pixel 7 with features like a 90Hz display and wireless charging. So it's not a budget phone, and it's not a midranger in the truest sense, but it does pack some serious value at its price point.  $499  at Amazon $499 at Google Store $449 at Best Buy

Text: The Google Pixel Fold might have stolen the show at the Google I/O on May 10 but there’s another device that we’ve been tracking. It’s been easy to keep tabs of the Pixel 7a given the number of leaks over the past few days.

Google Pixel 6a was one of our favourite smartphones from 2022. It was the first Google smartphone to debut in India after a hiatus of sorts. But since then Google has made it clear that India is a priority market and followed up the launch of the Pixel 6a with the unveil of its Pixel 7 and 7 Pro smartphones alongside their global launch. It should come as no surprise that the Pixel 7a has arrived in India along with key global markets. We recommended the Pixel 6a to many users who were looking for a flagship Android experience that didn’t cost a bomb. It’s no coincidence that the Pixel 7a has been launched with the same sticker price as its predecessor. Is this the best Android smartphone under Rs 50K?

We’ll start by saying that the Pixel 7a creates a conundrum of sorts for Google fans in India. Should you go for the Pixel 7 that has benefitted from a price drop? You can now snag it under Rs 50K and that puts it directly in the same price zone as the Pixel 7a. We like the design of the Pixel 7a, it stays faithful to the chic Pixel template that we dig. We checked out the sedate Charcoal colour option, it also comes in two other pleasing shades – Sea and Snow. We think the Sea colour variant might be the bestseller; it’s one of the coolest shades on any smartphone right now. Google opts for a plastic back and a refined aluminium frame but it can pass off for glass just like the Pixel 6a could. It’s tough to tell the Pixel 6a and 7a apart. But look closer and you will see a couple of key differences. There’s no two-tone finish and we like the camera band on the 7a better.

It’s not just those subtle design elements, the Pixel 7a is almost 10% heavier than its predecessor and almost the same heft as the Pixel 7 despite a similar battery size. The big change you are likely to notice first is the display. Google adds a 90Hz refresh rate to this 6.1-inch OLED display (1080 x 2400 pixels / 429 PPI) and addresses one of our gripes about the 6a. This display is a lot more immersive whether you’re scrolling web pages or gaming. I pushed this device to the limit and it didn’t stutter. It’s powered by the same Google Tensor G2 chip that is at the heart of the Google Pixel 7 and 7 Pro. This chip allows the phone to leverage the best of Google whether it’s photography or just everyday performance.

If there’s one reason we like Pixel phones, it’s that Pixel cam. The Pixel 7a takes a big leap over its predecessor with its dual rear cam. This one combines a 64MP primary lens and a 13MP ultra-wide lens. On paper it’s better than the Pixel 7. We found the results were in the same league as the Pixel 7; it’s tough for us to pick a winner here. Google’s Night Sight is one of our favourite lowlight photography solutions on any smartphone cam and the Pixel 7a is no exception. We also enjoyed using the Long Exposure Mode that adds extra energy to your images. You also get all our Pixel favourites like Photo Unblur and Magic Eraser.

The Google Pixel 7a is one of the best smartphones you can buy under Rs 45,000. It adds extra features over its predecessor like wireless charging and extra RAM. The big question for Google is the positioning of its Pixel ‘a’ series phones and how they are different from devices like the Pixel 7. The Pixel 7a scores with its stellar camera, elegant design and dependable battery. But most of all it’s that pureplay Google experience that seamlessly integrates the hardware and the best of Google smarts that makes it a compelling proposition.

The Google Pixel 7a (8GB/128GB) costs Rs 43,999 and comes in Charcoal, Sea and Snow colour options. Google is offering an instant discount of Rs 4,000 on HDFC Cards.

The latest member in the Google Pixel series is the new Pixel 7a, which is also part of the company's more accessible a-series of devices. Starting at $499, the Pixel 7a shares the spot with the Pixel 4a 5G as the most expensive a-series Pixel yet and is only $100 less than the Pixel 7.

Suddenly, then, the cheaper a-series phone doesn't seem all that cheap anymore. After all, why not spend the $100 extra if you are getting a better phone with the Pixel 7? But that's the conundrum here, as things aren't as clear-cut as you might think. The question isn't why wouldn't you spend extra for the Pixel 7. The question is, why would you?

Google Pixel 7a specs at a glance:

Body: 152.0x72.9x9.0mm, 194g; Glass front (Gorilla Glass 3), aluminum frame, plastic back; IP67 dust/water resistant (up to 1m for 30 min).

Display: 6.10" OLED, HDR, 90Hz, 1080x2400px resolution, 20:9 aspect ratio, 429ppi; Always-on display.

Chipset: Google Tensor G2 (5 nm): Octa-core (2x2.85 GHz Cortex-X1 & 2x2.35 GHz Cortex-A78 & 4x1.80 GHz Cortex-A55); Mali-G710 MP7.

Memory: 128GB 8GB RAM; UFS 3.1.

OS/Software: Android 13.

Rear camera: Wide (main): 64 MP, f/1.9, 26mm, 1/1.73", 0.8µm, Dual Pixel PDAF, OIS; Wide (main): 13 MP, f/2.2, 120˚, 1.12µm.

Front camera: 13 MP, f/2.2, 20mm (ultrawide), 1.12µm.

Video capture: Rear camera: [email protected]/60fps, [email protected]/60/120/240fps; gyro-EIS, OIS; Front camera: [email protected], [email protected]

Battery: 4385mAh; 20W wired, PD3.0, 18W wireless.

Connectivity: 5G; eSIM; Wi-Fi 6e; BT 5.3; NFC.

Misc: Fingerprint reader (under display, optical); stereo speakers.

You see, the Pixel 7a is about as close to the Pixel 7 as an a-series phone has ever gotten. Looking through the spec sheet, both phones have a surprising number of similarities. Both have a similar resolution display refreshing at 90Hz. Both have the exact same Tensor G2 chip inside and very similarly sized batteries. The Pixel 7a even adds wireless charging, something that has been missing on a-series phones in the past.

The differences then come down to the camera configuration and the display size. The camera figures all boast of a higher megapixel count on the Pixel 7a but we know that rarely amounts to anything. And the display is smaller, which means the phone itself is also smaller. Not necessarily a bad thing.

So it's an interesting matchup then and the more expensive Pixel 7 will have to fight harder than its predecessor to justify its existence. Let's see how the Pixel 7a performs.

Unboxing

The Pixel 7a ships in extremely minimal packaging that is barely bigger than the phone itself. Aside from the phone, all you get in the box is a USB-C charging and data cable as well as a USB-C male to USB-A female adapter.

The somewhat barebones packaging is a good way to save cost and the environment but buyers in this segment are often looking for more value and it doesn't help Google's case that most of its competitors are offering at least a charger in the box, with many also providing a case.

Design

The Pixel 7a looks visually identical to the Pixel 7. Both phones have a flat front display with sizable bezels around them, curved sides, and the same large camera bar at the back. Like the more expensive Pixel 7 models, the Pixel 7a loses some of the character of its predecessor, as the back is no longer two-tone and the camera bar lacks that distinctive visor look.

Google Pixel 7a hands-on review

The main difference between the Pixel 7a and the Pixel 7 is the size. Due to the smaller display, the Pixel 7a is smaller by a few millimeters. This makes the phone feel noticeably more manageable in hand as it is much easier to hold and carry and you can also access more of the display with your thumb without stretching. The camera bar on the back is also slimmer and doesn't stick out as much.

The other difference is the choice of materials. The Pixel 7a still uses aluminum for the frame and the camera bar but the two are no longer cut out of the same piece of metal. Also, the back cover is plastic and not glass. These changes are honestly quite difficult to notice and don't really make the phone look and feel particularly worse than the more expensive model.

Getting back to the bezels, they really are quite chunky and distracting on the Pixel 7a and even thicker than they were on the Pixel 7. On their own, they may not be larger than those found on other phones without a curved display but since the display on the Pixel 7a is relatively small, the bezels seem much larger in perspective. The centrally located front camera can also detract from the content you are watching.

The right side of the phone has the physical switches. Like on the more expensive models, the buttons on the Pixel 7a are rather stiff but due to the size of the device they are always within easy reach.

Like the Pixel 6a, the Pixel 7a is IP67 rated for dust and water resistance. This is something that is usually lacking on the cheaper phones and while the Pixel 7a isn't as affordable, at least you can have peace of mind while using the phone in less-than-ideal conditions.

Display

The Pixel 7a has a 6.1-inch OLED display with a 2400 x 1080 resolution and 90Hz refresh rate. The display has similar specifications to the more expensive Pixel 7 aside from being 0.2 inches smaller.

The display on the Pixel 7a may be on the smaller side but it's sharp and mostly color accurate, at least on the Natural preset. The display gets sufficiently bright with the manual slider and can get even brighter in Auto mode under bright light. The display will also adjust its contrast to improve legibility under sunlight.

Like all OLED panels, you also get great contrast and motion performance. There is some color fringing when viewed off-axis but it's nominal and only noticeable on brighter-colored content or when not using dark mode.

The 90Hz refresh rate on the Pixel 7a is a huge bump up from the 60Hz on all previous a-series phones. Unfortunately, in that time, most of the competition has now moved on to 120Hz, even on much cheaper models. So while it's definitely an improvement, at this point we expect higher refresh rates from phones in this price range.

Fortunately, with Google, you mostly get what it says on the tin. While other companies may advertise 120Hz and only provide 60Hz at times, the Pixel 7a sticks to its 90Hz limit in most scenarios. Only in select scenarios, such as while watching videos, in the camera, or in games that don't support higher refresh rates will the display drop down to 60Hz. This makes for a much more consistent experience, as a steady 90Hz is any day preferable over a refresh rate that keeps bouncing between 120Hz and 60Hz.

The Pixel 7a also supports HDR10, HDR10+, and HLG content. Google clearly has a better understanding of how HDR should work compared to its contemporaries in the Android space and as a result, HDR content does look quite striking with great colors and respect for the original content brightness level. The lack of Dolby Vision is a shame but not a deal breaker.

Battery life and charging

The Pixel 7a has a 4300mAh battery that is almost the same size as the one on the Pixel 7. While we didn't run our full battery life test, the Pixel 7a had excellent battery life in our usage, lasting an entire day even with extended usage. On average, we were seeing close to 7 hours of screen time, including long photography sessions.

Google Pixel 7a hands-on review

The Pixel 7a supports 18W of wired charging, a step down from the already anemic 20W supported by the Pixel 7. As a result, charging speeds are very slow by today's standards especially when looking at the full charge figure, which takes almost two hours. For reference, the OnePlus Pad with its 9510mAh battery charges more quickly.

Higher is better

* Tap/hover over the device names for more info

The big new feature on the Pixel 7a compared to its predecessor is the addition of wireless charging. Of course, this would be even slower but anyone who charges wirelessly knows speed has never been the reason to have this feature.

Speakers

The Pixel 7a has stereo speakers with one at the bottom and the other being the earpiece. The speakers can get quite loud but the audio quality is mediocre. There isn't much bass to speak of as you would get on larger, more expensive phones nor is there much high-frequency detail.

Instead, you get more focus on the mid-range and although that does help amplify vocals they tend to sound tinny. This is fine for watching videos with a lot of spoken content but not for more cinematic content or music. The good thing about speakers is that the channels are well-balanced and the sound is much more centrally located than on many of the cheaper phones with stereo speakers.

The Pixel 7a comes out of the box with Android 13. Being a Pixel device, we don't need to talk about any skins or wonky update schedules. Google says the phone will get 5 years of security updates and they should at the beginning of every month as they always do for Pixel phones.

The software experience is the bread and butter of Pixel phones and that's no different on the Pixel 7a. You are essentially getting the same software and feature set as on the more expensive Pixel phones. However, the experience here is different compared to most other Android phones, even those that have a close to 'stock' Android UI.

With Pixel phones, the focus has always been on a minimal, clean experience. Google is very judicious with how frequently it adds new features and elements to the UI and this can be a double-edged sword. If you are a fan of minimalism, you will appreciate the lack of overwhelming options presented by other manufacturers and also appreciate the sort of clean slate approach where you as the user can choose to manually add as many features as you want through third-party apps without Google forcing anything on you.

This is even seen in things like the apps that come pre-installed. You get a list of Google apps while setting up the device that you can choose to install. If you uncheck all of them, you get a very minimal app drawer with about 24 apps. This is the lowest you can get on an Android device as almost every other manufacturer crams as many apps as they can while also not giving you the option to remove most of them.

The other side of this sword is that some of the niceties we have come to expect from other devices are missing here. You get limited UI customizability so things like custom app icons, fonts, or themes are out of the question. You get split-screen multitasking but features like floating windows and side drawers for quick access to apps found on other phones are not present here. Even basic things like being able to uninstall multiple apps at once or press and hold on an app icon and get the uninstall option aren't present on the Pixel, forcing you to slowly and laboriously uninstall them.

If you are into consuming media (and let's face it, who isn't?) then you won't find popular formats like Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos here. Instead, Google has chosen to go with the far less popular HDR10+ and its own spatial audio feature, the latter of which only really works in the Google TV app at the moment. And if you want to use wireless headphones, you may be disappointed to know that there is still no support for the increasingly popular LHDC codec. The Pixel phones also won't let you use passive audio adapters for using wired headphones, forcing you to invest in more expensive active USB DACs.

Even the fixed monthly software update schedule can be a frustration at times. If there is a particularly annoying bug other manufacturers can just push out an update overnight to fix it. With Google, you have to wait till the beginning of the next month for the earliest fix and even then the fix may not arrive. And let's not pretend that Pixel phones aren't super buggy at times, especially after launch.

This has always been the case with Google smartphones where they have always been behind the curve compared to other Android manufacturers. That was the cost you had to pay for the clean software design. But we now know that doesn't have to be the case. Companies like Motorola and Nothing have shown that you can do a clean, minimal 'stock' Android design while also having custom features and flourishing that neatly integrate within the Android UI/UX while adding additional functionality.

What Google excels at is services. The company is able to leverage its advancements in machine learning and AI to come up with some nifty features. This includes things like Call Screen which uses Google Assistant to answer calls from unknown numbers to filter out spammers, Direct My Call for navigating automated calling systems using a visual UI, Now Playing for identifying songs playing nearby even when offline, Top Shot for recommending a better shot when you take a slightly blurry one, Face Unblur, and more. These features remain exclusive to the Pixel series and Google often adds new ones through its Pixel Feature Drops.

Aside from that, Google also often has a more pragmatic and sensible approach to implementing features. There is a battery optimization feature but it never aggressively kills background apps to save power, the 90Hz refresh rate number isn't just for marketing and is something you can experience in most apps and games, HDR content actually looks like it should without the phone messing with it, and the camera doesn't automatically apply beauty filters to your face or the moon. These may seem like small things individually but they contribute to the overall experience.

So there is certainly a bit of give and take here and it all comes down to what you value the most in your smartphone. With the Pixel, you are getting a clean software experience but only at the cost of losing some built-in functionality that other manufacturers provide. We think there is room for a middle ground here between feature-rich but overly aggressive Android reskins and a clean but barebones Android experience, and companies like Motorola and Nothing seem to be on the right track at the moment. Google can certainly learn from that while maintaining everything that it currently does.

Performance

The Pixel 7a packs the same Tensor G2 chip as the more expensive Pixel 7 phones. It then combines that with an adequate 8GB of LPDDR5 memory and rather limiting 128GB of UFS 3.1 storage. There are no other memory and storage configurations available.

The presence of the Tensor G2 on the Pixel 7a makes a lot more sense than on the Pixel 7 Pro. The G2 isn't quite on the same level as the best that Qualcomm has to offer and was marketed more for its AI and machine learning capabilities rather than brute strength. That said, it is sufficiently powerful for the price class the Pixel 7a is in.

The Pixel 7a performs well for its class in benchmarks with especially strong GPU performance. However, the issues with the G2 lie outside of benchmarks. The G2 suffers from the same optimization issues that non-Qualcomm branded chips face, which is that developers usually don't optimize for this chip as the overwhelming majority of phones use Snapdragons. This results in less than satisfactory performance, where apps on the G2 can often stutter or struggle a bit compared to even slower Qualcomm chips.

The G2 is also a less efficient chip, meaning it consumes more power for the same amount of work and turns a lot of that into heat. The relatively small body of the Pixel 7a can't dissipate it fast enough so it throttles much more quickly than the larger Pixel 7 Pro. Even within a short 10-minute stress test, the Pixel 7a drops down to 80% of its performance, a number that's even lower if the ambient temperatures are higher. Compared to, say, the Snapdragon 778G+ on the Nothing Phone (1), a chip that is otherwise slower, the G2 loses more of its performance over time, causing it to get slower during the stress test than the 778G+, which is able to maintain its performance over a much longer period.

Google's AI and machine learning claims for the G2 are also nebulous at best. We can't compare how much better some of the Pixel features work on other phones since they are Pixel exclusive but even using the image editing features like portrait blur in the Google Photos app, the Nothing Phone (1) was able to apply the same effect faster than the Pixel 7a.

And since we are comparing it to the Phone (1), the Nothing phone almost always feels nicer to use than the Pixel 7a due to the 120Hz display and generally smoother scrolling performance. This isn't to say that the Pixel 7a is bad but the combination of 90Hz and occasional stuttering in apps drags down the user experience.

The thermal issues also crop up in gaming, where the Pixel 7a tends to heat up much quicker than its larger siblings, which results in throttling and the game dropping frames. If it gets too warm, the phone will eventually dim its display. This is also something that happens quite regularly while taking photos and videos with the phone for longer than a couple of minutes and makes it hard to see what you are shooting. The quality of image processing is also affected when the phone overheats, especially for digitally zoomed images.

In the end, the Tensor G2 on the Pixel 7a has good performance on paper for its class but its somewhat poor efficiency, inferior third-party optimization, and the phone's limited thermal headroom makes this phone best suited for non-power users.

The Pixel 7a has a dual camera system on the back consisting of a 64MP main camera with f/1.89 aperture and 1/1.73" sensor size and a 13MP ultrawide camera with f/2.2 aperture. Like the Pixel 7, the ultrawide on the Pixel 7a does not have autofocus and as such also lacks the macro mode found on the Pixel 7 Pro.

Both cameras on the back are physically smaller than those on the Pixel 7 despite the higher resolutions. This usually isn't a great combination but we have seen software overcoming these hardware limitations in the past.

5. Conclusion

The phone isn't without its flaws, however. The chunky bezel and 90Hz refresh rate seem a bit outdated even in this price range. The charging is one of the slowest we have come across in recent times even by Pixel standards. And the Tensor G2 is just not a particularly good chip.

Even taking all that into consideration, we still had a good time using the Pixel 7a. There is something very alluring about a relatively small, clean phone that isn't trying to be everything for everyone. It's simple, uncomplicated, and unpretentious. It's a phone you can recommend to people of all ages without specific needs and know they will be happy with it. To put things simply, the Pixel 7a is what we like to think of as the new default smartphone.

Softtitle: Google Pixel 7a Review: The Best Android Phone Under $500, Tons Of Power—And Megapixels—For The Money
Publisher: Forbes

Text: The Google Pixel 7a is the new champion of mid-range Android phones. With its Google Tensor G2 processor and an upgraded camera array that includes a 64-megapixel main camera, the Google Pixel 7a stands atop our list of best Android phones under $500. At $499, this model costs less than the slightly larger Google Pixel 7, and it delivers excellent security (thanks to the Titan M2 security coprocessor) and update options in an uncluttered, Google-centric phone environment.

Traditionally, Google’s “a” series phones packed less of a punch than its flagship Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro devices. And “a” phones came out at a lower price around the midpoint of the flagship series’ lifecycle. This year, the Pixel 7a edges closer to the abilities of the Google Pixel 7, with the addition of Google Tensor G2 processor—same as on the Pixel 7—wireless charging and capable cameras with even more megapixels than on the Pixel 7 (although that model has three rear cameras to the 7a’s two).

I’ve been testing the Google Pixel 7a for nearly a week, and I am impressed with how much this phone delivers. Read on for why I believe this phone stands out as the best Android phone under $500.

The Google Pixel 7a’s design is an evolution of what we saw last fall with the release of the Google Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro series. With its curved edges and distinctive camera bar on the back, the Pixel line stands out from the crowd. The Pixel 7a has one obvious difference, though: It has a 3D thermoformed composite back (put more simply, “plastic”) cover. The Pixel 7 and 7 Pro use a glass back cover.

At 6.0 x 2.9 x 0.4 inches, the Google Pixel 7a has virtually identical dimensions to the Pixel 6a—unsurprising since both models have a 6.1-inch display (the Pixel 7a is 0.1-inch wider). A similarly minor distinction stands between the Pixel 7a and the Pixel 7, which has a slightly larger 6.3-inch display and stands 0.1-inch taller). The Pixel 7a’s composite cover and scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass 3 design comes in the middle of those three phones, too: The Pixel 7a weighs 6.8 ounces, compared to the Pixel 7’s 7 ounces and the Pixel 6a’s 6.3 ounces.

I found this model’s 6.1-inch display—same as on the Google Pixel 6a—a pleasant change of pace. While the Pixel 7a has a smaller display than typical flagship phones, like the Google Pixel 7 Pro (6.7-inch), it was great to have a phone that fit easily into my jeans pocket. It was also simpler to hold with one hand for snapping photos, but was large enough for casual web surfing, watching TikToks and reading emails. However, when the time came to edit a Google Doc or watch a two-hour movie, I admittedly preferred the larger display of Google Pixel 7 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. Even though the Pixel 7’s screen was slightly larger than that of the Pixel 7a, I didn’t find that a meaningful enough difference.

The Pixel 7a’s design follows its Pixel predecessors, with a wake button and a volume rocker along the right edge. Its dual-SIM card slot sits on the left edge, while two speakers flank the USB Type-C port on the bottom edge. (The phone also supports eSIM.) This phone not only supports fast USB charging, but it’s also the first “a”-series phone from Google with Qi wireless charging—one addition that may explain why this phone’s price is $50 more than what the Pixel 6a started at.

The phone comes in four casing colors: charcoal, sea, snow and coral (a Google Store exclusive). The official Google cases come in matching colors. (My test unit was charcoal, with a seafoam green case.) The phone was comfortable to hold bare, thanks to its smaller size. With Google’s case, the phone was even easier to grip. I loved the supple, gently textured case design of the Pixel 7a’s case, a welcomed improvement over the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro’s hard, smooth case. The Pixel 7a case felt grippy in my hand, without the rubbery design found on some cases.

Let’s talk about the Pixel 7a’s software. Google’s Pixel phones provide the purest version of Android, as Google intends for you to use its phone operating system. While you don’t get a ton of apps from third-parties pre-loaded, Google earmarks a slew of its own apps and services for pre-loading (though you can opt out of some during the installation process).

As a company, Google builds AI into its on-device machine learning, enabling a slew of AI-assisted features that make the phone more personal and customized. Like the other Pixel 7 models, the Pixel 7a transcribes in real-time, translates conversations, helps with phone calls and makes suggestions for framing and how to shoot your images. The AI can also play an important role when capturing or editing photos and video.

While I found the Recorder app’s ability to transcribe incredibly useful, the camera app’s suggestions were a more mixed bag: Some, like the on-screen level, were useful, while other guidance was more of a nuisance. For example, I didn’t find a pop-up suggesting I move the phone back “to improve focus” as helpful as having a visual focus cue (as seen on other cameras). I used the AI-powered Magic Eraser to remove items from an image, with impressive on-screen results (I didn’t inspect the image pixel-by-pixel on a larger screen). The feature had limitations, though: I removed a car from an image shot in the twilight hour, and while the car itself was gone, its shadow remained.

One big advantage to the Google Pixel 7a—which puts it ahead of its similarly priced competitors—lies with its software updates. Google guarantees 5 years of security and operating system updates. This is important given some manufacturers can barely get one update out a year.

You also get a free, 3-month trial subscription to YouTube Premium and Google One (which includes a whopping 100GB of cloud-based storage for phone backups and photos).

The Google Pixel 7a’s 2,400 x 1,080-pixel FHD+ OLED display packs in 429 pixels per inch, and it has Google’s “Smooth Display” setting for raising the refresh rate from 60Hz to 90Hz for some content.

New is an always-on display (configurable during set up, to control what appears on the display (including at-a-glance notifications, calendar alerts, weather, time and more). I could also choose Dark Theme, which I preferred since it helped the interface pop more and was easier on my eyes.

One of the biggest upgrades to the Google Pixel 7a lies with its camera array. According to Google, the main camera sensor is 72% larger than the sensor on the Pixel 6a—although it’s still not as big as the sensor on the Pixel 7 or Pixel 7 Pro. The Google Pixel 7a’s impressive array has a 64-megapixel wide camera—which at launch is the highest megapixels of any phone camera among the under $500 phone class.

It also has a 13-megapixel, ultra-wide camera and a 13-megapixel front camera. By contrast, its predecessor, the Pixel 6a, had a less impressive set of cameras, with a 12.2-megapixel wide camera, 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera and 8-megapixel front camera. Note that while the Pixel 7a beats the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro on megapixels, I found that those cameras still eked out better performance in low-light, simply by virtue of their larger-sensor.

The main camera has Google’s Super Res Zoom up to 8x, but I was less impressed with the resulting images. Zoomed to the max, the leaves on distant trees looked mashed up. I noticed the same lack of crisp detail in full-size images when I cropped in on a PC, too. The Pixel 7a lacks a macro mode (found on the Pixel 7 Pro), which I sorely missed for my close-up shots of flowers.

The Google Pixel 7a’s rear video camera records at 4K or 1080p video (at either 30fps or 60fps). I liked the way Google adds Slow Motion and Time Lapse as part of the video button, handy for experimenting on-the-fly with different shooting methods.

The phone comes with 128GB of UFS storage. That’s enough for most everyday tasks and a healthy complement of apps and photos. But expect to store your images and videos in the cloud (via Google Photos or another service) if you plan to capture lots of photos and 4K videos. Each image was just shy of 2MB, which adds up quickly. (I blasted through 7.5GB in one afternoon’s outing to test the cameras.)

The Google Pixel 7a comes with 8GB of RAM, and the Google Tensor G2 processor, same as found in the flagship Pixel 7 and 7 Pro models. I had no issues playing casual games, navigating web pages and switching among modes. I sometimes felt the camera could be snappier when taking successive images, but even the Pixel 7 Pro occasionally stuttered.

While colors look bright and vibrant on the Google Pixel 7a display, they fall short of the rich color and sharp details I saw on the Google Pixel 7 Pro (with its 2,400 x 1,600 display). Some images lacked tack-sharp clarity when viewed at a larger size on a laptop.

One comment about the display: I found the screen had a slight gray color cast, same as I saw on a Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. The difference jumped out to me when I viewed the Pixel 7a side-by-side with a competing device. This was most obvious when viewing web pages or documents.

One pleasant surprise was how good audio sounds on the Google Pixel 7a. The stereo speakers piped out full-bodied, rich audio, which was a noteworthy contrast to the tinny, anemic audio produced by the Google Pixel 7 or Pixel 7 Pro on the same YouTube Music tracks. I was also happier with the clarity and depth of voices, both via the speakerphone and the phone’s earpiece.

The Google Pixel 7a strikes an appealing balance between price and features among mid-range phones. It packs enough power and security options that you won’t feel you miss out by not going with a flagship phone twice the price, and its camera has innovative AI-driven features to complement its excellent quality.

The Pixel 7a’s specs and features stand out well among the mid-range phone crowd. The hardware is a big upgrade over the Google Pixel 6a, which still strikes a chord at its lower price if you’re after a budget Android phone. If you want a phone under $500, the Pixel 7a is the best choice.

The biggest reasons to go with a flagship-level phone are if you want a larger, more pixel-dense display, larger internal storage capacity or greater camera controls—including even higher resolution images. The OnePlus 11 5G and the Google Pixel 7 Pro both provide strong value among larger-screen phones—albeit at a higher price.

The real decision comes in when you’re deciding between the Pixel 7a and splurging a little more for the Pixel 7. Are there are differences beyond the marginally larger display, and but finding them requires digging beyond the typical bullet points for specs (for example, both have wireless charging, but the Pixel 7 can wireless charge at nearly three times the speed of the Pixel 7a—and you can share its battery with other devices). The differences may be subtle, but if they matter to you the extra cost for the Pixel 7 may be worthwhile, particularly if you can find it on sale.

Otherwise, the Google Pixel 7a ticks most boxes of what you need in a phone. And it does so without putting a big dent in your wallet.

I’ve written about consumer technology for over two decades. My first cell phone was a Nokia 6160 (a classic), and I’ve reviewed cell phones since the days when Nokia and Ericsson dominated the market—long before the first Apple iPhone came out. I was at the launch of the first iPhone, and I reviewed that model, along with many of the early Android phones. I’m also a photographer, and love capturing memories and quiet moments on the one camera I have with me at all times: my cell phone.

I tested the Google Pixel 7a as a clean device, without transferring my settings, apps, photos or contacts from my previous phone (though that was an option). During the setup process, I configured face recognition, fingerprint recognition and a PIN code.

I downloaded additional apps and used the phone daily as my primary communications tool, comparing it with the Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro, as well as the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. I paid close attention to the display when using it in a wide range of lighting situations—indoors and outdoors. I played YouTube videos at the same settings on multiple devices to gauge audio output and image quality. I watched streaming video, played games, listened to music and made phone calls. I observed screen quality and brightness, as well as how snappy the phone felt while engaged in common tasks. And I tested the camera array, both indoors and out.

Text: We’re still deeply impressed by the Pixel 7, a smartphone that managed to offer a flagship experience for just $600. But the new Pixel 7a costs just $500 and manages to match most of the Pixel 7a’s specs—an interesting proposition, to say the least.

The Pixel 7a is now readily available, and we’ve already performed an in-depth review of the device. So, for those who want a detailed view of the specs without too many opinions, here’s everything you need to know about the Pixel 7a.

The Pixel 7a debuted at Google’s I/O 2023 developer event. And, in an odd twist, the device immediately went on sale immediately after this event—no pre-order necessary. You can now buy the Pixel 7a at Google’s website, or from your carrier or retailer of choice.

While last year’s Pixel 6a was just $450, the new Pixel 7a is $500. This may seem like a harsh price increase, but to be fair, the Pixel 7a is a massive upgrade over its predecessor. Not only is it the first Pixel A-series phone to feature wireless charging and a 90Hz display, but it uses a new camera array that matches the quality of more-expensive Pixel 7.

That said, the standard Pixel 7 costs $600. That’s only $100 more than the Pixel 7a. Given the similarities between these two phones, we expect customers to have a hard time deciding which one they want to purchase.

Note that the Pixel 7a only comes in a 128GB storage configuration. But it’s available in four colors—Charcoal, Sea (light blue), Snow, and Coral (which is a Google Store exclusive, unfortunately).

Like last year’s Pixel 6a, the Pixel 7a uses a 6.1-inch display. But the phone itself has clearly grown in size. The Pixel 7a measures at 6 x 2.8 x 0.4 inches (152 x 72.9 x 9.0 millimeters)—it’s barely any smaller than the standard Pixel 7!

Of course, the Pixel 7a’s screen is a bit smaller than that of the Pixel 7 (which uses a 6.3-inch panel). And its display is surrounded by thicker bezels. But this is the first “A-series” phone to use a 90Hz display; something that, until now, was exclusive to Google’s flagship devices.

But it should be noted that the Pixel 7a uses a plastic backside. And in our review, we found that the fit and finish isn’t fantastic. The seam between the phone’s aluminum frame and plastic backside is a bit scratchy, so you’ll probably want to use it with a case. (Our sister site, How-to Geek, came to the same conclusion in its review.)

And although the Pixel 7a is a premium-looking phone, it did miss out on a few upgrades. It still uses Gorilla Glass 3, rather than the Gorilla Glass Victus featured in Google’s flagship phones. Dust and water resistance is also unchanged—the Pixel 7a is rated at IP67, while the Pixel 7 is IP68.

On the bright side, a recent teardown video shows that the Pixel 7a is somewhat easy to repair. There aren’t any ribbon cables tethering the back of the phone to its internal hardware, and the screen can be replaced without too much trouble.

Pixel A-series phones offer exceptional performance for the price. And, predictable, the Pixel 7a continues this trend. It utilizes the same Tensor G2 chipset that you’ll find in the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro—essentially, it offers flagship performance for a fraction of the price.

In our tests, we found that the Pixel 7a matches the performance of its more expensive siblings. It’s a snappy phone, and even some heavy-duty features like Night Sight perform quite well. That said, the Pixel 7a’s 6GB of RAM makes it less adept for multitasking and some hardcore apps (and this will become more apparent as the phone grows older).

The Pixel 7a is also limited to just 128GB of non-expandable storage. This is a common limitation for phones at this price. Still, some users will find that 128GB isn’t enough space. If you install a lot of apps, download a lot of offline movies or music, or shoot a ton of photos and videos (without a paid Google Photos subscription), you may need additional storage.

Notably, this is the first Pixel A-series phone with wireless charging. It’s a fantastic addition and one of the most-requested features from customers, although wireless charging speed is capped at 7.5 watts, so it’s really only useful if you use a wireless charger while sleeping.

The Pixel 7a’s 4,385mAh battery is actually a slight downgrade, as the Pixel 6a had a 4410mAh capacity. In our review, we found that the Pixel 7a has no trouble lasting all day on a charge, even when forced to run at 90Hz. But some reviews, including the one published at How-to Geek, had a more tumultuous experience with battery life. (We suspect that battery life will be one of those “Pixel problems” that affects some customers, but not others.)

One of the downfalls of last year’s Pixel 6a was the main camera. Not because it was bad—in our review, we found that the Pixel 6a takes some great photos. The issue is that the Pixel 6a reused Google’s 12MP camera sensor, which is pretty outdated and doesn’t match the quality of the 50MP camera utilized in the Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 flagships.

The Pixel 7a makes a giant leap to a 64MP main camera. On paper, this may seem like a better camera than what you get with the standard Pixel 7. But megapixels are just one component of camera quality. Our testing shows that the Pixel 7a’s camera quality is basically identical to that of the standard Pixel 7.

Additionally, the Pixel 7a upgrades to a 13MP ultra-wide camera and a 13MP selfie lens. These cameras match the photo quality of the ultra-wide and selfie lenses included in the Pixel 7. There really isn’t a notable difference, at least in our testing.

Given the similarities between the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7a, we believe that customers will have a hard time choosing between these phones. I suggest that you read our in-depth review of the Pixel 7a to see which model we prefer based on pricing, features, and build quality.

Here is how the Google Pixel 7a compares to the Pixel 6a. Should you upgrade, or which should you buy if you're in the market for a mid-range Pixel?

The Pixel 7a is Google's latest mid-range phone. It succeeds the Pixel 6a, and sits alongside the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, offering a number of great specs and features and bridging the gap even more between flagship and mid-range.    The Pixel 6a is no longer Google's latest affordable phone, but it still offers incredible value for money, taking much of the Pixel 6 experience and condensing it down to a more affordable package. It's still a great mid-range phone.   $339  at Amazon See at Amazon $329.99 at Amazon $320.41 at Amazon

POCKET-LINT VIDEO OF THE DAYSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT

Google announced its latest mid-range smartphone - the Pixel 7a - at its I/O developer conference on 10 May. In the months leading up to the event, there were numerous rumours and leaks surrounding the device, but now everything has been made official and we have ourselves a new mid-range marvel.

The Pixel 7a sits alongside the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, and it succeeds the Pixel 6a, though you will still be able to buy the 2022 model through Google and a number of other retailers.

With that in mind, we've compared the specifications of the the Pixel 7a to the Pixel 6a to help you work out what the differences are, whether it is worth upgrading, and if you're in the market for a mid-range Pixel, should you get the Pixel 7a or the Pixel 6a?

Let's start with pricing and availability. The Google Pixel 7a was announced on 10 May at Google I/O and it was made available immediately after. The Pixel 6a remains in the Pixel line-up, much like what Apple does with its iPhone models.

The Google Pixel 6a cost $449 in the US when it first launched, £399 in the UK and €459 in Europe, though it is typically available for less now. The Pixel 7a meanwhile, starts at $499 in the US, £449 in the UK and €509 in Europe, so its base price is a little more than the Google Pixel 6a.

Below you'll see a table of the Pixel 7a's specs compared to the Pixel 6a's specs. We've gone into more detail about the differences a little further down though as specs aren't everything so that's worth keeping in mind.

The Google Pixel 7a shares an almost identical design to the Pixel 6a, with a couple of minor tweaks. It features a flat display like the Pixel 6a, offering a centralised punch hole camera at the top and an under-display fingerprint sensor at the bottom.

The rear meanwhile, has a dual rear camera system within a camera housing that spans the width of the device, again like the Pixel 6a. Where the Pixel 6a has a dual-colour rear though, with the top of the rear a different colour to the bottom, split by the camera housing, the Pixel 7a has just one colour like the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro. The camera bar is a lot more premium, however, so it looks like a better quality phone.

The Pixel 6a measures 152.2 x 71.8 x 8.9mm and weighs 178g. It comes in Black, White and Green colour options. The Pixel 7a measures 152.4 x 72.9 x 9mm and weighs 193g - so nearly identical in measurements, though heavier in weight than its predecessor. The colour options are Charcoal, Snow and Sea, though there is also a Coral option available through the Google Store.

In terms of water and dust resistance, the Pixel 6a is IP67, which the Pixel 7a retains. The Pixel 7 and 7 Pro are both IP68 for reference.

The Google Pixel 6a has a 6.1-inch OLED display sporting a Full HD+ resolution at 2400 x 1080 pixels, which delivers a pixel density of 429ppi.

The Pixel 7a offers the same size and resolution as the Pixel 6a, though it increases the display's refresh rate from 60Hz to 90Hz, which puts it in line with the Pixel 7. The Pixel 7 Pro has a 120Hz refresh rate in case you're wondering. This display is also a little brighter than the Pixel 6a.

The Pixel 7a offers the Face Unlock feature available on the Pixel 7 devices however, which means an additional biometric option to the under-display fingerprint sensor.

Elsewhere, the user experience is the same between the Pixel 6a and the Pixel 7a with features like an always-on display, At A Glance calendar/weather info and the Now Playing functionality offered on both devices.

The Google Pixel 7a runs on the second generation of the Tensor chip called Tensor G2, like the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. This is an upgrade to the Pixel 6a, which runs on the first-generation of the Tensor chip. There's also an upgrade in RAM on the Pixel 7a too.

The Pixel 6a has 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage as a base, while the Pixel 7a offers 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage in the base model.

When it comes to battery, there are some upgrades for the Pixel 7a here too, though not in terms of capacity. In fact, it sees a slight reduction in battery. The battery capacity of the Pixel 7a is 4385mAh compared to the Pixel 6a's 4500mAh capacity. There is 7.5W wireless charging on board though, which is a first for a Pixel "a" device. Wired charging tops out at 18W, so it's nowhere near the likes of the Realme GT 3 and it's 240W charging, but that won't be a deal breaker for most.

The Google Pixel 7a makes camera improvements over its predecessor too. It has a 64-megapixel main camera sensor, coupled with a 13-megapixel ultra-wide sensor.

The Pixel 6a has a similar camera setup to the Google Pixel 5 with a 12.2-megapixel main camera and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera. It therefore means Google has upgraded both the main camera and ultra-wide sensor on the Pixel 7a.

The Pixel 6a has a great camera offering overall, and while we did come across a little software bug in our Google Pixel 7a testing, results from the camera are excellent. There are some brilliant features too, including Magic Eraser for removing unwanted objects in the background, Real Tone for ensuring all skin tones are displayed accurately and Face Unblur, which essentially means no more blurry selfies. All of these are on the 7a and 6a.

When it comes to the front camera, the Pixel 6a has an 8-megapixel sensor, but the Pixel 7a upgrades to a 13-megapixel sensor so there have been some solid improvements here too.

The Google Pixel 7a offers a number of solid improvements over its predecessor, making it our top choice if your budget allows.

The design and display remain similar to the Pixel 6a, though there are a few tweaks, including a more seamless design, faster refresh rate and Face Unlock, bringing in a number of features from the Pixel 7

The Google Pixel 7a is the company's latest mid-range smartphone and it brings a number of excellent improvements over its predecessor, putting it closer in line with the Pixel 7.  $499  at Amazon $499 at Best Buy

The main camera and ultra wide camera both get an upgrade too, along with the processor, front camera and there are other extra features too, like wireless charging.

The Google Pixel 6a is still an excellent device though, with a fantastic price now so it's a no brainer if your budget doesn't stretch far enough for the Pixel 7a.

The Pixel 6a take much of the Pixel 6 experience and condensing it down to a more affordable package. It might have been replaced by the Pixel 7a now but it's still a fantastic option.  $339  at Amazon See at Amazon $329.99 at Amazon $320.41 at Amazon

Text: *  Not ready to upgrade just yet?

After months of rumors, the Pixel 7a is finally here. As the successor to the Google Pixel 6a, it's got some big shoes to fill. That phone made its mark as one of the best budget Android phones in 2022, thanks to its powerful hardware, great cameras, and premium construction, and the 7a looks to take it up to a whole new level.

As you might expect, this year's Pixel 7a pulls inspiration from last year's Google Pixel 7 and Google Pixel 7 Pro. Google's latest flagship devices are its best yet, perfectly setting up the 2023 A-series phone to be a budget homerun. From its Tensor G2 chipset to that brand-new 90Hz display, here's everything we know about the Google Pixel 7a so far.

ANDROIDPOLICE VIDEO OF THE DAYSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT

The Pixel 7a isn't just a successor to last year's Pixel 6a. It also marks the biggest leap for the A-series yet, bringing it closer than ever to parity with its flagship-level siblings. It does so at a price, however, as the Pixel 7a gets a price hike up to $500.  $499  at Amazon $499 at Google Store $449 at Best Buy

More than ever, the Google Pixel 7a is nearly indistinguishable from the Pixel 7. In its white colorway especially, the Pixel 7a reuses the same matte silver frame, the same glossy back, a two camera setup — more on that below — and a flat display upfront. Comparing dimensions, Google's upcoming budget phone is nearly the exact same size as the Pixel 7, with last year's budget flagship measuring just a bit wider, taller, and thinner overall.

Walk into your nearest carrier and hold the two phones side-by-side, and you'll notice a couple of additional changes. The camera visor — that signature bump that has become Google's iconic marker for its current design language — is much thinner than the one on the Pixel 7. It all comes down to the Pixel 7a's camera sensor; because it's smaller, Google could shrink the overall design into something a bit more svelte. The camera bar also includes a matte aluminum cover now, rather than opting for the basic glass on the previous gen, but unfortunately, the bezels around the display remain as chunky as ever.

So what sets this phone apart from the rest of the company's lineup? Well, the Pixel 7a comes in two unique colors you won't find among the more neutral tones of the Pixel 7 series. A sky blue model keeps the pastel trend going, matching the more subdued colors of recent Google products, while the coral variant is far more in your face, looking far more vibrant in person than the company's renders would have you believe. If you want that orange-ish shade, just keep in mind it's a Google Store exclusive — no carriers or third-party retailers will sell it.

The Pixel 7a is powered by the same Tensor G2 chipset found in the mainline Pixel 7 series, alongside 8GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 128GB of UFS 3.1 storage. It's rocking a 6.1" FHD OLED panel that has finally been upgraded to 90Hz, bringing it closer to competition from Samsung and OnePlus, though you'll need to enable it in settings out of the box.

It's powered by a 4,385mAh battery alongside 18W wired charging and — new this generation — wireless charging. Unfortunately, Google's limited its device to just 5W wireless, so you'll want to keep this tool limited to the stands on your bedside table.

Of course, if the Pixels are known for one thing above all else, it's their cameras. Google is using a 64MP sensor here alongside a 12MP ultrawide lens that — fun fact — is actually about six degrees wider than the lens used on the Pixel 7. That main shooter is brand new to the Pixel lineup, but outside of the actual hardware being utilized here, it's business as usual. Google is continuing to bin its images — down to 16MP here — and while its Super Zoom leaves something to be desired, 1x or 2x photos match the quality you'd expect from a Pixel phone. Google also upgraded the front-facing camera to 13MP and, as a nice bonus, it supports face unlock for faster access to your smartphone.

At this point, if you've used a recent Pixel phone, you likely know what to expect when it comes to hardware. Unlike with its legacy Nexus phones, the Pixel series provides a wholly unique take on Android, one focused on a clean aesthetic and providing you with tons of AI-powered tools and features. The Pixel 7a fails to break that trend, promising the same experience you've come to love on the Pixel 7 series at a lower cost. Google is also guaranteeing the same level of support as it does for its flagships, with three major OS upgrades to kick off with Android 14 later this year.

Android 14 is on track for another August release this year, and with Google's latest mid-range smartphone dropping in May, it's obviously well ahead of that date. Android 14 will be one of its first big updates post-launch, though, following a Pixel Feature Drop expected in June. And hey, we've already seen our earliest previews of what this year's upgrade is shaping up to look like. In fact, once you have your Pixel 7a in hand, joining in on the beta should be as easy as any other supported smartphone.

While recent A-series entires stretched their release dates into the summer and beyond, Google is getting back to basics this year. The Pixel 7a went up for order on May 10th, right after Google wrapped up its keynote at I/O. As for in-store availability, you can also grab a new smartphone from your local Best Buy — not too shabby. It brings the A-series back to as May release for the first time since the original Pixel 3a in 2019.

Now for the bad news: Google is raising its A-series pricing, bumping up the Pixel 7a to $500. At that price, the Pixel 7a might be a hard sell — we've seen the Pixel 7 as low as $350 on sale, and outside of those exclusive colors, there isn't a major feature that makes the 7a an obvious choice over its older brother.

Not ready to upgrade just yet?

If you felt that the Pixel 7 or Pixel 7 Pro were too pricey, the Pixel 7a might be just what you want. And if its new $500 price tag feels a bit too steep for you, history suggests a deluge of sales could be just a couple of months away.

The Pixel 7a isn't just a successor to last year's Pixel 6a. It also marks the biggest leap for the A-series yet, bringing it closer than ever to parity with its flagship-level siblings. It does so at a price, however, as the Pixel 7a gets a price hike up to $500.  $499  at Amazon $499 at Google Store $449 at Best Buy
